## 2. Business Model and Revenue

Mintpay (PVT) LTD operates primarily on a 
**Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) business model** where revenue is generated from **merchant fees** and **consumer late fees** , not interest.
Business Model
Mintpay provides a platform that allows consumers to purchase goods and services from partner merchants and pay for them in interest-free instalments, typically over three payments across two months. The core value proposition for merchants is increased basket size and purchase frequency, while for consumers it is payment flexibility without extra interest. Mintpay uses a proprietary machine learning and data analysis decisioning engine to instantly assess customer eligibility and manage risk.
Revenue Streams
The primary revenue streams for Mintpay are:
  * **Merchant Commissions** : Mintpay charges its partner merchants a commission or transaction fee for each sale made through the platform. The exact percentage is not publicly disclosed but is the main source of income, as Mintpay pays the merchant the full amount upfront for the purchase.
  * **Consumer Late Fees** : While the service is interest-free if payments are made on time, Mintpay charges specific late fees for missed instalments.
  * **"Pay Now" Option** : For customers who choose to pay in full upfront using Mintpay's payment gateway, Mintpay likely earns a smaller transaction fee from the merchant, similar to standard payment processors.


Pricing Strategy
Mintpay's pricing strategy is bifurcated for its two main customer bases:
For Consumers
  * **Interest-Free Instalments** : Mintpay offers its "Pay Later" service with **no interest** or additional fees, provided payments are made on the scheduled dates.
  * **Late Payment Penalties** : Specific late fees are applied if an instalment is missed. An initial fee of **Rs. 500/-** is charged on the due date, with an additional **Rs. 300/-** applied if the payment remains unpaid after 7 days and another **Rs. 300/-** if unpaid after 14 days, up to a maximum of **Rs. 2,200/-** per transaction.
  * **Cashback Rewards** : Mintpay incentivizes both "Pay Now" and timely "Pay Later" payments with **Mint Coins** , a loyalty points program where coins can be redeemed for future purchases at partner stores.


For Merchants
  * **Merchant Fees** : Mintpay's pricing for merchants involves a commission on sales. This fee is justified by the platform's ability to boost average order values by up to **30%** and increase purchase frequency, driving new customers to the merchant's business.
  * **Full Upfront Payment** : Mintpay guarantees merchants are paid in full and upfront for transactions, removing the risk associated with customer non-payment.
  * **Integration Support** : The service is integrated with major e-commerce platforms, and Mintpay assists with the technical integration for businesses of all sizes.

## 18. Challenges and Opportunities

In 2026, Mintpay (PVT) LTD continues to navigate a rapidly evolving fintech landscape in Sri Lanka, defined by a national push to reduce cash circulation to 
**3.5% of GDP**.
**Business Challenges & Risks**
  * **Regulatory Uncertainty:** As of early 2026, stakeholders are lobbying for a unified fintech regulatory authority to streamline approvals. Currently, fintechs often must partner with banks to channel transactions, which can limit direct customer registration and transaction smoothness.
  * **Credit Risk & Fraud:** Managing defaults remains a core risk. Mintpay mitigates this through a proprietary **Decisioning Engine** that uses non-traditional data (e.g., digital footprints) to perform instant credit checks.
  * **Cybersecurity Threats:** Escalating digital threats in 2025–2026 require constant investment in security to prevent breaches that could erode public trust and disrupt financial systems.
  * **Operational Limitations:** Users have noted slow increases in spending limits and a desire for more merchant variety, particularly in the tech sector.


**Opportunities**
  * **Strategic Partnerships:** Expanding beyond retail into high-utility sectors like **travel (FitsAir)** , **dining (Softlogic Restaurants)** , and **hospitality (Cinnamon Hotels)** allows Mintpay to become a lifestyle payment tool.
  * **Financial Inclusion:** By enabling **debit card** holders—who far outnumber credit card holders in Sri Lanka—to use installment plans, Mintpay taps into a massive underserved market.
  * **Enhanced Consumer Value:** New features like **"Pay Now"** with instant cashback and gift vouchers offer diverse ways to drive transaction volume beyond traditional BNPL.
  * **Merchant ROI:** Mintpay reports driving up to a **30% increase in average order value** and **50% higher purchase frequency** for its partner merchants, incentivizing more brands to join.


**Threats**
  * **Sector Volatility:** If a single "bad egg" fintech fails or acts unethically, it could trigger a regulatory crackdown or loss of trust across the entire industry.
  * **Traditional Bank Competition:** Banks are increasingly launching their own short-term installment plans, directly competing for Mintpay's core value proposition.
  * **Economic Sensitivity:** While BNPL thrives during shifts in living costs, extreme economic resets can impact overall consumer purchasing power.

## 21. Innovation and R&D

Mintpay (PVT) LTD, Sri Lanka's first "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) platform, has focused its R&D and innovation initiatives on building a proprietary technological stack to disrupt traditional credit models
.
Key innovation and R&D initiatives as of early 2026 include:
  * **Proprietary Decisioning Engine:** Mintpay developed an alternative credit deciding system that does not rely on third-party credit bureaus. It uses non-traditional data points, such as **digital footprints** and **keystroke dynamics** , to perform instant credit checks and assess user "creditworthiness".
  * **"Pay Now" and Reward Systems:** Expanding beyond BNPL, the company introduced the "Pay Now" feature, which uses an automated cashback system called **Mint Coins**. This initiative aims to incentivize ethical consumer behavior and provide instant savings for full payments.
  * **Strategic Banking Integrations:**
    * **DFCC Bank Partnership:** An initiative to extend BNPL and "Pay Now" options specifically to **debit cardholders** , a segment often excluded from traditional installment plans.
    * **Seylan Bank Collaboration:** Focused on confirming service viability and iterating on an end-to-end user experience to minimize transactional losses for merchants.
  * **Sector-Specific Payment Solutions:** Research and development have been directed toward diversifying into new industries, such as the travel sector through partnerships with **Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts** and **FitsAir** to transform travel payment solutions.
  * **Financial Literacy & Ethical Consumerism:** Mintpay integrates financial education principles within its platform to ensure consumers avoid unsustainable debt.
  * **Future Tech Investment:** Following successful seed funding, the company is actively investing in enhancing its technology stack's robustness to scale its operations across South Asia.
