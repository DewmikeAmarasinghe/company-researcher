## 4. Company History

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), widely known as

**Founding & Early Origins**
  * **The Ice Kompaniya (1866):** Founded by German engineer **Arthur Von Possner** as the Colombo Ice Company, it imported the island’s first commercial ice-making machine. Its location on Glennie Street led the local area to be colloquially named **Kompaniveediya** (Company Street).

## 15. Future Plans

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), known for its 
**Elephant House** brand, is pursuing a dual-track strategy focusing on aggressive regional expansion and domestic operational modernization.
**1. Regional & Global Expansion**
  * **India Market Entry:** CCS has partnered with Reliance Consumer Products Limited (RCPL) to manufacture and distribute Elephant House beverages in India. The initial phase targets South India (253 million population) due to similar flavor palates.
  * **Australia Launch:** In December 2025, the company officially launched **Elephant House Ice Cream** in Australia, marking its first manufacturing venture outside Sri Lanka.
  * **Reciprocal Partnerships:** The franchise agreement with Reliance also allows CCS to introduce the “Campa” brand of energy drinks into the Sri Lankan market.


**2. Domestic Growth Strategy**
  * **Retail Footprint:** Through its subsidiary **Keells** , CCS is expanding its supermarket network and converting standard outlets into extended formats. Plans include a focus on the high-income Western Province, which currently holds 80% of its store presence.
  * **High-Margin Focus:** The manufacturing segment is pivoting toward "impulse" products (e.g., individual ice cream units) which offer higher margins compared to bulk products.
  * **Infrastructure Investment:** CCS recently acquired a PET bottling and can manufacturing plant in Ittapana to vertically integrate and future-proof its beverage portfolio.


**3. Future Roadmap (2025–2027)**
  * **Financial Targets:** Earnings are projected to reach **LKR 8.1 billion in FY26E** and **LKR 9.4 billion in FY27E** , driven by same-store sales growth and international royalties.
  * **Digital Transformation:** Ongoing roadmap includes supply chain digitization, advanced data analytics for the Nexus loyalty program, and process optimization to counter LKR depreciation risks.
  * **Sustainability Integration:** CCS is aligning with IFRS Sustainability Reporting Standards (S1 & S2) for its next reporting cycle to attract ESG-focused investment.

## 18. Challenges and Opportunities

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), operating under the iconic 
**Elephant House** brand, faces a mix of macroeconomic pressures and strategic growth paths in the Sri Lankan market.
**1. Business Challenges**
  * **Consumer Spending Volatility:** While demand has recently shown signs of recovery, a potential reduction in **VAT tax brackets** under the 2026 budget could place fresh pressure on disposable income.
  * **Margin Contraction:** EBIT margins have seen pressure due to higher advertising, promotional, and distribution expenses as the company drives brand development and network expansion.
  * **Energy Costs:** Significant past increases in electricity and fuel rates continue to impact production and logistical efficiency.
  * **Supply Chain Fragility:** Climate change and environmental factors, such as **Cyclone Ditwah** , have caused localized disruptions to supply and shifts in consumer demand.


**2. Risks**
  * **Currency Depreciation:** High import dependence for raw and packing materials makes CCS vulnerable to LKR fluctuations, which can inflate production costs.
  * **Liquidity and Debt:** The company has experienced high short-term borrowings and a negative cash position, requiring vigilant management of credit risk.
  * **Regulatory Changes:** Upward revisions to **sugar taxes, VAT, and excise duties** pose ongoing risks to pricing strategies and product profitability.
  * **Inflationary Pressure:** Sustained inflation can erode consumer purchasing power and escalate the cost of key inputs like milk and sugar.


**3. Opportunities**
  * **Indian Market Expansion:** A strategic partnership with **Reliance Retail Ventures** allows CCS to enter the massive Indian consumer base, starting with the South Indian market.
  * **Product Innovation:** Opportunities exist in high-margin **impulse products** , energy drinks (via the **Campa** brand), and health-conscious options with reduced sugar.
  * **Retail Growth:** The **Keells** supermarket chain is positioned to capture rising demand from urban population growth and a shift from general trade to modern retail formats.
  * **Digital Transformation:** Leveraging advanced data analytics can improve distribution efficiency, customer targeting, and operational excellence.


**4. Threats**
  * **Intense Competition:** Growing rivalry in the supermarket sector and from multinational beverage/confectionery brands requires continuous innovation and aggressive pricing.
  * **Macroeconomic Instability:** Any return to the severe instability seen in 2022—characterized by scarcity of foreign exchange and power disruptions—remains a systemic threat to operations.
  * **Consumer Preference Shifts:** Rapid changes in consumer health awareness may threaten traditional high-sugar carbonated soft drink (CSD) volumes if not addressed by product reformulation.

## 22. Social Responsibility

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), operating under the brand 
**Elephant House** , manages its social responsibility and sustainability through its dedicated CSR arm, Gunadamin Elephant House. Its strategy is built on three core pillars: **Waste Management** , **Sustainable Sourcing** , and **Community**.
1. Waste Management & Environment
Elephant House focuses heavily on reducing plastic pollution and promoting a circular economy through various partnerships:
  * **Plastic Recycling Initiatives** : In collaboration with Plasticcycle (a John Keells Group initiative) and Zerotrash, CCS invests in recycling collection centers and Material Recovery Facilities (MRF).
  * **Women-Led Recycling** : A partnership with **USAID** and **Viridis Pvt Ltd** trains and equips women to gather recyclable plastics and metals, fostering economic empowerment and resilience.
  * **Environmental Cleanup** : Ongoing projects include cleaning up sacred sites like Adam’s Peak, where they collected over 22,000 PET bottles in 2025 for recycling through Eco Spindles.
  * **Packaging Innovation** : Collaboration with Neptune Recyclers to advance PET recycling and develop sustainable packaging solutions.


2. Sustainable Sourcing
The company prioritizes local procurement to support rural economies and ensure ethical supply chains:
  * **Local Ingredient Sourcing** : Ingredients such as Natural Vanilla, ginger, and jaggery are sourced directly from local farmer associations, reviving industries like the **Kandy Vanilla Growers Association (KVGA)**.
  * **Farmer Support** : CCS provides knowledge sharing, sustainable farming techniques, and stable purchase plans to help farmers withstand adverse weather and improve yields.


3. Community Development
CCS aligns its social efforts with the John Keells Foundation:
  * **Health & Nutrition**: The Gift of Vision program provides free eye care and cataract surgeries. Additionally, the **"Saara Midula"** project educates employees on home gardening to promote self-reliance on nutrition.
  * **Crisis Relief** : During the COVID-19 pandemic, CCS distributed over 10,000 packs of essential goods to disadvantaged households across the island.
