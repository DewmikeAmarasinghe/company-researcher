    "content": "DirectPay Sri Lanka is a leading fintech company that was founded in \n**2018** as a subsidiary of the established solutions provider PayMedia. It was created by co-founders **Kanishka Weeramunda** (CEO), **Dinesh Karunathilaka** , and **Sasindu Pathiranage** with the vision of developing a digital-first payment ecosystem in Sri Lanka.\nFounding Story\nThe idea for DirectPay arose from the observation that while smartphones had changed many aspects of life, payments in Sri Lanka still relied heavily on cash and physical wallets. The founders, who had already built successful banking solutions through their parent company PayMedia, recognized the potential for digital payments to disrupt the local market. They envisioned a future where traditional banking would decline in favor of seamless, 24/7 digital services.\nThe company was among the first to support the **LankaQR** standard, demonstrating its early commitment to national digital payment infrastructure. The initial period was challenging, as the concept of fintech was in its infancy in the country, but DirectPay received early support from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and LankaClear, who saw the potential for the startup's innovative solutions.\nGrowth Timeline and Milestones\n  * **2017:** The DirectPay solution was the runner-up for \"Most Innovative Solution\" at the Hemas Slingshot Startup Battle at Disrupt Asia 2017.\n  * **February 2018:** DirectPay was officially launched as a fintech startup specializing in digital payments.\n  * **2018:** The company won the \"Gold award for Sri Lanka\" at the Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) and the \"Best Startup Award\" at the NBQSA awards.\n  * **2020:** Within just 20 months of operation, DirectPay processed LKR 2 billion worth of transactions.\n  * **June 2021:** The total transaction value processed by DirectPay surpassed LKR 3 billion, making it the fastest-growing fintech in the country.\n  * **August 2021:** DirectPay partnered with the Commercial Bank of Ceylon to enhance its offerings of customized digital payment solutions for businesses in insurance, education, and e-commerce industries.\n  * **February 2023:** DirectPay celebrated its 5-year anniversary and announced it had achieved an impressive LKR 13.5 billion in transactions.\n  * **October 2024:** The company announced it had achieved an extraordinary **1000x growth in 60 months**.\n  * **Present:** DirectPay has integrated with the government's **GovPay** platform, which has surpassed LKR 1 billion in digital transactions and connected over 200 government institutions, further expanding its influence on national digital infrastructure.\n\n\nKey Services\nDirectPay offers a comprehensive suite of digital payment solutions to cover the entire payment ecosystem:\n  * Mobile-based payment apps\n  * Internet payment gateways (IPG)\n  * Payment links for remote payments\n  * Subscription and recurring payment management\n  * Bill settlement services\n  * Platform-as-a-service solutions for other banks and institutions\n\n\nTheir goal is to provide secure, affordable, and reliable solutions that foster financial inclusion and help Sri Lanka move towards a cashless society.\nAI responses may include mistakes.

    "content": "DirectPay, a rapidly growing Sri Lankan fintech company, faces a dynamic market characterized by increasing digital adoption but also significant cybersecurity and regulatory challenges\n.\nBusiness Challenges\n  * **Merchant Onboarding and Registration** : DirectPay requires merchants to be registered businesses, which can be a barrier for micro-merchants or freelancers who are not yet formally registered.\n  * **Credit Access for SMEs** : The limitations in existing financial traceability laws in Sri Lanka make it harder for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to access credit, a problem DirectPay is trying to solve by enabling digital transaction histories, but it requires regulatory alignment.\n  * **Cash-on-Delivery Dominance** : A large percentage of e-commerce payments in Sri Lanka are still cash-on-delivery, requiring continuous effort to shift consumer behavior towards digital channels.\n  * **Operational Delays** : The merchant screening process, necessary for Central Bank compliance, can take up to a week, potentially impacting rapid business onboarding.\n\n\nRisks\n  * **Cybersecurity Threats** : Sri Lanka is experiencing a surge in financial phishing incidents and cyber-attacks, posing a significant risk of data breaches and financial loss.\n  * **Regulatory Deficiencies** : Existing cybersecurity guidelines for fintechs in Sri Lanka are not legally enforceable, and there is a lack of consumer protection laws that mandate restitution for fraud victims, which could erode public trust in the digital payment system if not proactively managed by DirectPay.\n  * **Economic Instability** : Distressed economic conditions in the country can negatively impact the financial sector, potentially leading to increased loan-loss provisions for partner banks and a general reduction in liquidity.\n  * **Third-Party Liability** : DirectPay's terms state they are not liable for losses caused by events beyond their control or those not resulting from their gross negligence, potentially shifting risk to merchants in certain scenarios such as chargebacks or network issues.\n\n\nOpportunities\n  * **Growing Digital Adoption** : Digital transactions in Sri Lanka surged by **45%** in 2023, indicating a significant and growing market for digital payment solutions.\n  * **Strategic Partnerships** : Collaborations with major banks like the Commercial Bank of Ceylon provide opportunities to expand services, offer internet payment gateways (IPG), and explore new areas like micro-lending and supply chain payments.\n  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : DirectPay offers underlying technology solutions to other financial institutions and fintechs, serving as a vital infrastructure provider in the ecosystem.\n  * **Product Diversification and Agility** : The company has successfully diversified its product suite (mobile apps, IPG, payment links, subscription payments) and has demonstrated agility in pivoting to new markets (e.g., B2B), which allows for resilience against market fluctuations.\n\n\nThreats\n  * **Intense Competition** : The Sri Lankan fintech space is competitive, with other players like OrelPay, NSBPay, PeoplesPay, and Helios.\n  * **Regulatory Changes** : New regulations and directions from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka regarding fees, charges, and consumer protection are expected in **2025** and beyond, which may require adaptation and compliance efforts.\n  * **Infrastructure Limitations** : While improving, gaps in national cybersecurity infrastructure and intelligence sharing compared to global standards remain a threat that could be exploited by sophisticated cybercriminals.\n  * **Erosion of Public Trust** : A major security breach affecting any key player in the financial system could disrupt the entire market and erode public trust in digital transactions, negatively impacting all fintech companies including DirectPay.\n\n\nAI responses may include mistakes.
