## 4. Company History

DirectPay Sri Lanka is a leading fintech company that was founded in 
**2018** as a subsidiary of the established solutions provider PayMedia. It was created by co-founders **Kanishka Weeramunda** (CEO), **Dinesh Karunathilaka** , and **Sasindu Pathiranage** with the vision of developing a digital-first payment ecosystem in Sri Lanka.
Founding Story
The idea for DirectPay arose from the observation that while smartphones had changed many aspects of life, payments in Sri Lanka still relied heavily on cash and physical wallets. The founders, who had already built successful banking solutions through their parent company PayMedia, recognized the potential for digital payments to disrupt the local market. They envisioned a future where traditional banking would decline in favor of seamless, 24/7 digital services.
The company was among the first to support the **LankaQR** standard, demonstrating its early commitment to national digital payment infrastructure. The initial period was challenging, as the concept of fintech was in its infancy in the country, but DirectPay received early support from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and LankaClear, who saw the potential for the startup's innovative solutions.

  * **2018:** The company won the "Gold award for Sri Lanka" at the Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) and the "Best Startup Award" at the NBQSA awards.
  * **2020:** Within just 20 months of operation, DirectPay processed LKR 2 billion worth of transactions.
  * **June 2021:** The total transaction value processed by DirectPay surpassed LKR 3 billion, making it the fastest-growing fintech in the country.
  * **August 2021:** DirectPay partnered with the Commercial Bank of Ceylon to enhance its offerings of customized digital payment solutions for businesses in insurance, education, and e-commerce industries.
  * **February 2023:** DirectPay celebrated its 5-year anniversary and announced it had achieved an impressive LKR 13.5 billion in transactions.
  * **October 2024:** The company announced it had achieved an extraordinary **1000x growth in 60 months**.
  * **Present:** DirectPay has integrated with the government's **GovPay** platform, which has surpassed LKR 1 billion in digital transactions and connected over 200 government institutions, further expanding its influence on national digital infrastructure.


Key Services
DirectPay offers a comprehensive suite of digital payment solutions to cover the entire payment ecosystem:
  * Mobile-based payment apps
  * Internet payment gateways (IPG)
  * Payment links for remote payments
  * Subscription and recurring payment management
  * Bill settlement services

Their goal is to provide secure, affordable, and reliable solutions that foster financial inclusion and help Sri Lanka move towards a cashless society.

## 5. Competitive Landscape

In the Sri Lankan market, DirectPay faces competition from a mix of local fintech startups, established commercial banks, and international payment platforms. These alternatives vary based on whether you need a merchant payment gateway for an e-commerce site or a mobile wallet for personal/retail use.
**Local Fintech Competitors**
These companies offer similar specialized digital payment services, often with easier integration for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) compared to traditional banks.
  * **PayHere** : Widely considered a top competitor for e-commerce, it is Central Bank-approved and supports a vast range of payment methods, including credit cards, mobile wallets (eZ Cash, mCash), and internet banking.
  * **WebXPay** : A leading SaaS-based gateway that offers over 14 payment options and specializes in helping MSMEs go online with features like payment links and automated invoicing.
  * **Onepay** : A growing alternative focused on no-code payment solutions, offering secure gateways with a low setup cost and support for LankaQR and UPI.
  * **PAYable** : Primarily focuses on providing mobile POS (mPOS) solutions and digital payment acceptance for physical retail merchants.


**Banking & Digital Wallet Alternatives**
Traditional banks have launched their own aggressive digital payment arms that directly compete with DirectPay's app-based services.
  * **Genie (by Dialog)** : A comprehensive "financial super app" that acts as both a digital wallet and a PCI-DSS certified payment gateway with competitive transaction rates.
  * **iPay (by LOLC)** : A major player in the merchant-based transaction space, offering a separate merchant application and integration with the national **JustPay** network.
  * **Solo (by HNB)** : A digital wallet and payment app from Hatton National Bank that focuses on QR-based retail payments and high flexibility for users.
  * **Upay** : An innovative digital payment platform (now part of SDB bank) that allows users to link multiple bank accounts and cards for seamless mobile payments.

## 18. Challenges and Opportunities

DirectPay, a rapidly growing Sri Lankan fintech company, faces a dynamic market characterized by increasing digital adoption but also significant cybersecurity and regulatory challenges
.
Business Challenges
  * **Merchant Onboarding and Registration** : DirectPay requires merchants to be registered businesses, which can be a barrier for micro-merchants or freelancers who are not yet formally registered.
  * **Credit Access for SMEs** : The limitations in existing financial traceability laws in Sri Lanka make it harder for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to access credit, a problem DirectPay is trying to solve by enabling digital transaction histories, but it requires regulatory alignment.
  * **Cash-on-Delivery Dominance** : A large percentage of e-commerce payments in Sri Lanka are still cash-on-delivery, requiring continuous effort to shift consumer behavior towards digital channels.
  * **Operational Delays** : The merchant screening process, necessary for Central Bank compliance, can take up to a week, potentially impacting rapid business onboarding.


Risks
  * **Cybersecurity Threats** : Sri Lanka is experiencing a surge in financial phishing incidents and cyber-attacks, posing a significant risk of data breaches and financial loss.
  * **Regulatory Deficiencies** : Existing cybersecurity guidelines for fintechs in Sri Lanka are not legally enforceable, and there is a lack of consumer protection laws that mandate restitution for fraud victims, which could erode public trust in the digital payment system if not proactively managed by DirectPay.
  * **Economic Instability** : Distressed economic conditions in the country can negatively impact the financial sector, potentially leading to increased loan-loss provisions for partner banks and a general reduction in liquidity.
  * **Third-Party Liability** : DirectPay's terms state they are not liable for losses caused by events beyond their control or those not resulting from their gross negligence, potentially shifting risk to merchants in certain scenarios such as chargebacks or network issues.


Opportunities
  * **Growing Digital Adoption** : Digital transactions in Sri Lanka surged by **45%** in 2023, indicating a significant and growing market for digital payment solutions.
  * **Strategic Partnerships** : Collaborations with major banks like the Commercial Bank of Ceylon provide opportunities to expand services, offer internet payment gateways (IPG), and explore new areas like micro-lending and supply chain payments.
  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : DirectPay offers underlying technology solutions to other financial institutions and fintechs, serving as a vital infrastructure provider in the ecosystem.
  * **Product Diversification and Agility** : The company has successfully diversified its product suite (mobile apps, IPG, payment links, subscription payments) and has demonstrated agility in pivoting to new markets (e.g., B2B), which allows for resilience against market fluctuations.


Threats
  * **Intense Competition** : The Sri Lankan fintech space is competitive, with other players like OrelPay, NSBPay, PeoplesPay, and Helios.
  * **Regulatory Changes** : New regulations and directions from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka regarding fees, charges, and consumer protection are expected in **2025** and beyond, which may require adaptation and compliance efforts.
  * **Infrastructure Limitations** : While improving, gaps in national cybersecurity infrastructure and intelligence sharing compared to global standards remain a threat that could be exploited by sophisticated cybercriminals.
  * **Erosion of Public Trust** : A major security breach affecting any key player in the financial system could disrupt the entire market and erode public trust in digital transactions, negatively impacting all fintech companies including DirectPay.

## 21. Innovation and R&D

. Their initiatives revolve around creating and enhancing practical, market-ready products to build a cashless economy in Sri Lanka.
Key Initiatives and Product Development

  * **LANKAQR/JustPay Integration** : A core initiative involves leveraging the national LANKAQR standard and the LankaPay CEFTS/JustPay network to facilitate low-value, account-to-account transactions using smartphones. This aims to eliminate high third-party verification costs and expensive equipment for merchants.
  * **Mobile Payment Solutions** : They have developed a user-friendly mobile application that allows customers to complete transactions by scanning a merchant's QR code, emphasizing security features like IMEI number verification and password protection.
  * **Comprehensive Payment Ecosystem** : Their development covers an entire payment ecosystem including:
    * **Internet Payment Gateway (IPG)**
    * **Payment links for remote payments**
    * **Subscription payment models**
    * **White-label apps**
  * **Strategic Partnerships** : DirectPay engages in partnerships to expand its reach and service offerings. A recent example is the collaboration with **Cita** to integrate payment and scheduling management into one platform.
  * **Security & Compliance**: Innovation in risk management and security is a significant focus, with the company adhering to global standards like **PCI DSS** and compliance with **Visa** and **MasterCard** regulations to foster user confidence and sustainability in the FinTech landscape.

**financial inclusion** and digital transformation in the country. The company aims to help create a cashless society, a goal that aligns with national development objectives and the Central Bank's sustainable finance roadmaps.

  * **Collaboration for a Digital Economy:** The company emphasizes collaboration with other fintechs and industry stakeholders, recognizing that a unified effort is necessary to accelerate the adoption of digital payments across Sri Lanka. They have been recognized with awards like the "Best Disruptor" for their efforts in enhancing the fintech landscape.
