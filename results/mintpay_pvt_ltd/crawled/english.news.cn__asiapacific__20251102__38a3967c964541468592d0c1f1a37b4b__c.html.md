COLOMBO, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's total government revenue excluding grants rose 24.8 percent year on year to 2,321.7 billion rupees (about 7.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of 2025, driven mainly by higher tax collections, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policies said in its mid-year fiscal report.
In the same period in 2024, the revenue was 1,860.6 billion rupees.
In the first half of 2025, tax revenue increased 25.9 percent to 2,151.1 billion rupees, up from 1,709.3 billion rupees a year earlier, the report said.
Key contributors included excise duty on motor vehicles, up 335.6 percent to 99.5 billion rupees, value added tax, up 27.6 percent to 170.4 billion rupees, customs import duties, up 92.7 percent to 45.2 billion rupees, and income tax, up 9.2 percent to 41.3 billion rupees, the report said.
The ministry said the stronger revenue performance is expected to support ongoing economic stabilization and fiscal consolidation efforts under the government's medium-term recovery plan. ■
