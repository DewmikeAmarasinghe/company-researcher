I've been using mint pay more than one year and It was a very convenient payment option for me. If we want to buy something in a time we don't have enough cash to pay at once we can pay one instalment and make it ours.
Aqeelah Lahir
I really like this app. The interface is user friendly and it gives timely reminders to make the payment.
Supun
The app is very easy to use. The only downside as far as I notice are the choices of shops available are very limited not many tech shops available and the payment limit is increasing very slowly. If you can provide many tech shops in Sri Lanka and also to increase the rate for the spending limit, this app is definitely a 5 star.
