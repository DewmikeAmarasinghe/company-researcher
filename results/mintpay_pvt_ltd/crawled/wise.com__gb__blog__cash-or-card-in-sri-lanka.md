Getting ready for a getaway to Sri Lanka? If so, you're likely working on your travel budget and itinerary. While this is a crucial part of trip planning, it's just as important to understand the payment practices of the locals. Some countries have fully adopted cashless payments, but cash is still a preferred method in Sri Lanka.
Cash remains the primary payment method in Sri Lanka, although cards are commonly accepted in most larger cities. How often you'll use each method depends on travel plans and your destination. In this guide, we’ll dive deeper into this and help answer the question - which is more convenient, cash or card in Sri Lanka?
We’ll also show you a cost-effective way to handle your finances in Sri Lanka with Wise. For any international purchases, online or in person, you can rely on the Wise card. You can even withdraw cash like a local for low fees and great mid-market exchange rates.
##  How cash-centric is Sri Lanka?
Although cards are commonly used in larger shops and hotels, cash is still the primary payment method. Not only is it accepted everywhere, it’s essential for paying tuk tuk drivers and street vendors.<sup>1</sup>
However, cards are popular in bigger cities and in tourist areas. Many well-known card brands, such as Visa and Mastercard, can be used in Sri Lanka. Diners Club and American Express cards aren’t used as much.<sup>1</sup>
###  Cash etiquette in Sri Lanka
Tipping is common and even expected in Sri Lanka, especially from tourists. In restaurants, a standard tip is 10% of the bill, though leaving more for great service is always appreciated.<sup>2</sup>²
You can also tip your taxi driver, but there’s no standard amount. On the other hand, it’s common to leave 50-100 Sri Lankan rupees to hotel and bar staff.<sup>2</sup>

##  Using your card in Sri Lanka at an ATM
Although Sri Lanka is a small country, around 25 banks operate within its territory, with a total of approximately 4,000 ATMs. You'll easily find them in city centers and major tourist areas, but they can be harder to locate in smaller towns. If you're staying in a more remote area, it's best to withdraw cash in advance.<sup>6</sup>
Sri Lankan ATMs are similar to any other standard ATM abroad and they usually accept Visa and Mastercard. The withdrawal limits range from 25,000 to 200,000 LKR, depending on the bank. ATM fees go up to 1,000 LKR, but you’ll also be able to find fee-free machines.<sup>6</sup>
The most popular ATMs are those owned by Bank of Ceylon, Hatton National Bank, DFCC Bank and Commercial Bank.<sup>6</sup>
##  Will my UK debit card work in Sri Lanka?
Visa and Mastercard are very commonly accepted in Sri Lanka. However, keep in mind that some smaller businesses may not accept cards at all. You can use your card in Sri Lanka, but it’s also important to have cash on hand.<sup>1</sup>
##  Can I use my UK credit card in Sri Lanka?
Yes, you can use your UK-issued credit card in Sri Lanka, as long as you go shop at places that accept cards.

Not carrying cash could also mean missing out on many experiences. For example, haggling is a traditional practice in Sri Lanka, and using cash is a key part of it. Without cash, you’ll also be unable to shop at small local stores or tip your servers.

##  Other payment methods in Sri Lanka
Besides the traditional cards and cash, other payment methods are available in Sri Lanka.
###  Mobile payment
In line with the biggest global trends, different mobile wallets and payment apps are gaining popularity in Sri Lanka. However, globally popular wallets, such as Google Pay and Apple Pay aren’t available here.<sup>8</sup>
One of the apps that Sri Lankans use instead of Google Pay and Apple Pay is HelaPay.⁸ Besides this, some options that have gained popularity are eZ Cash, FriMi and mCash.<sup>9</sup>
If you plan on using any wallet apps during your trip, make sure you update them before you leave to avoid any issues.
For an additional layer of security, you could add your Wise virtual card to your wallet. It has all the benefits of a regular Wise card, but it exists in your phone only. You can freeze your Wise virtual card after every transaction, too.
###  Buy now pay later options (BNPL)
Sri Lankans also use Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options for both online and in-store purchases. One of the leading providers is Payd, a payment service that divides your bill into three installments.<sup>10</sup>
Payd offers up to six weeks for repayment. Users who make regular payments can gradually increase their spending limit and enjoy these benefits.<sup>10</sup>
