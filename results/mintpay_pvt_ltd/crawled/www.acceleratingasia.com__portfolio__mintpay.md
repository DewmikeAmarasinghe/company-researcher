Mintpay is a shopping aggregator that simplifies shopping decisions. Mintpay offers a suite of products including flexible payment options, cashback rewards and voucher discounts. By partnering with leading retailers, they offer consumers an all-in-one platform to find the best deals, save money, and manage their purchases. Their solution also provides valuable data insights to retailers, allowing them to convert more customers and increase sales. Mintpay was established with the aim of improving financial literacy and access to financial services in the South Asian region. While in developed markets, traditional credit is easily accessible, for emerging markets such as South Asia, the case is quite the opposite which is evident by the low credit card penetration. The lack of access to traditional credit coupled with limited financial literacy impacts the consumer purchase power which contribute to limited turn over for retailers.By democratising credit in a responsible manner, Mintpay is improving consumer purchase power, thereby helping merchants to generate increased sales.
Every transaction that goes through Mintpay is subject to approval which is performed by our proprietary Decisioning Engine. This Decisioning Engine uses non-traditional data points such as digital foot print, key stroke dynamics to perform credit checks instantly. The ease of use and the convince makes Mintpay a more robust use case today. They also have integrated financial education principles, in order to ensure that consumers avoid unnecessary debt which they cannot repay. 
They have been operating since the 3rd quarter of 2020 and have witnessed an exponential growth while maintaining a positive cashflow. They have partnered with over 1000 merchants including Samung and Adidas. Their platform is being used by over 120,000 consumers. Mintpay is here to reshape the future of online shopping in South Asia.
