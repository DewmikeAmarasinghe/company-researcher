Mintpay, a financial app reshaping how people pay in Sri Lanka, has announced a partnership with Softlogic Restaurants. 
This collaboration aims to enhance the dining experience for food enthusiasts by offering convenient, secure, and flexible payment options. 
Softlogic Restaurants, renowned for its portfolio of beloved brands such as Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Crystal Jade, Delifrance, and Baskin Robbins, will now enable customers to enjoy a wide variety of cuisines through Mintpay’s seamless digital payment solution.
Mintpay Account Manager Sasra Wickrama Arachchi stated, “At Mintpay, we aim to transform every payment into a rewarding moment, and we believe this partnership with Softlogic Restaurants delivers on that promise, making every meal more rewarding.”
Mintpay Senior Business Development Executive Faziha Farhan added, “At Mintpay, we’re always expanding our network by partnering with brands that share our vision for seamless and rewarding payments. 
We’re excited to welcome Burger King, the first global QSR brand in Sri Lanka to integrate Mintpay, alongside other renowned Softlogic restaurants. This partnership marks another step in transforming the dining experience for all our customers, offering greater flexibility and convenience whenever they use Mintpay.”
Softlogic Restaurants (Pvt) Ltd General Manager - Operations Samitha Senaka commented, “This partnership with Mintpay is a significant step toward providing our customers with better payment solutions. By integrating Mintpay, we are creating a seamless and rewarding dining journey across all our Softlogic restaurant brands.”
This alliance supports Sri Lanka’s growing shift toward cashless transactions and digital-first experiences. By giving customers the choice to Pay Now to get Instant Cashback or Pay later for interest-free installments, Mintpay aims to bridge the gap between convenience and control.
Through this strategic partnership, Mintpay reinforces its role as an innovator in payment technology, while Softlogic Restaurants continues to elevate the local dining landscape. 
Mintpay is a financial app that offers a range of payment solutions, including Pay Now for up to 10 percent instant cashback and Pay Later to spread the cost into 3 interest-free installments using any debit or credit card. 
The platform also features gift vouchers redeemable at over 2,000 stores.
Softlogic Restaurants is a fully-owned subsidiary of Softlogic Holdings PLC.
