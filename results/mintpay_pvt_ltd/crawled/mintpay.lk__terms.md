If any fees or charges are imposed as a result of our error or system failure, please provide us with a copy of the relevant records, and we will reimburse you for the relevant fees or charges.
  4. If an Automatic Payment fails (for example, if your Nominated Payment Source is a credit or debit card which has expired), Late Fees may apply unless you otherwise make the scheduled payment on or before the relevant due date. You authorize us to satisfy any monetary liability you owe us by:
    1. Debiting your Nominated Payment Source at a later time or date;

  1. If you decide to return goods to a the merchant, which have been purchased using Mintpay, and request a refund, or a return and refund are otherwise accepted by the Merchant or permitted by law, you will directly arrange the return with the Merchant, ensuring that the goods are returned according to the Merchant’s returns policy or other instructions or your rights at law.
  2. It is your responsibility to notify the Merchant if you intend to return any goods. The return must be completed within the period specified by the Merchant and, in the manner, required by the Merchant’s returns policy or as otherwise permitted by the Merchant.
  3. Unless we are notified by a Merchant that a return and refund is in progress, we will continue to process any Automatic Payments in accordance with the dates set out in your Payment Schedule.
  4. Until such time that the Merchant has confirmed the return of the goods and has issued a refund to us for those goods, you will remain liable to us for the full payment of the goods, in accordance with your Payment Schedule.
  5. Once the merchant has issued a refund to us for the goods, we will issue a refund to your Nominated Payment Source (or, if that is not possible, to any other Card that you have provided details of) and/or adjust your Payment Schedule appropriately (including to reduce or cancel any future payments, if necessary). Please note, in the event of partial refunds, refund amounts are taken off the last payment/s first. If the refund is processed to your expired or cancelled card, you will need to obtain the returned funds by contacting your financial institution. For example, if you make a rupee 3000/- purchase using Mintpay and the retailer approves a rupee 1500/- refund, we will cancel your 3rd instalment of rupee 1000/-, and amend your 2nd instalment to rupee 500/-. Your new payment schedule will become 2 payments (instead of 3) of rupee 1000/- & rupee 500/-. If you had already paid 2 instalments of rupee 1000/- each, a refund of rupee 500/- would be applied to your card and the remaining 3rd instalment would be cancelled.
  6. Where you wish to return a Product 90 days or more after the Order date, we will no longer have any involvement in the Product return process (i.e. the Merchant will provide any agreed refund directly to you). A longer period will apply where we have agreed a longer period with the Merchant where required based on the nature of the goods Ordered by you.
