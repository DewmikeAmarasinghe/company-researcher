Mintpay have been our partners on our online marketplace for a few years now and have been such a pleasure to work with. They have supported us and our customers, offering them opportunities to make online shopping easier. So much so that this year we finally rolled out the Mintpay option to all our brick and mortar stores as well. Thank you, Mintpay! We look forward to many more successful years as partners.
