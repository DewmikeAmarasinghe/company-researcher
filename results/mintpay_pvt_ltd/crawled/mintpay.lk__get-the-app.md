I've been using mint pay more than one year and It was a very convenient payment option for me. If we want to buy something in a time we don't have enough cash to pay at once we can pay one instalment and make it ours.
Aqeelah Lahir
I really like this app. The interface is user friendly and it gives timely reminders to make the payment.
Supun
The app is very easy to use. The only downside as far as I notice are the choices of shops available are very limited not many tech shops available and the payment limit is increasing very slowly. If you can provide many tech shops in Sri Lanka and also to increase the rate for the spending limit, this app is definitely a 5 star.

I have been using Mintpay for more than 3 years, and it has been an amzing experience! The app is simple, reliable, and makes shopping so much easier with its flexible payment options. Transactions are smooth, and I've never faced any issues. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a convenient BNPL service!
