### Avoid; Unstructured, impetuous, money hungry
#### Systems and Process Lead
St. Peters, MO
Worked here for 30 days and had my position eliminated overnight by corporate. Terrible communication, no accountability, no originality, no sense of giving back to the community. They claim to be the "Starbucks or QT of weed" but are more like the KMart. Avoid if you want to keep your sanity.
