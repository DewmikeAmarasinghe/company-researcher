How to increase my split limit?

Can I make purchases above my split limit?
Yes, if you have no pending payments, you can make purchases that exceed your split limit. You will need to pay the additional amount along with the first instalment. You can check how the instalments are split on Mintpay's checkout page before you finalise the purchase.
What happens if I miss my due payments?
  * At Mintpay, we're committed to helping you stick to your repayment plan. We send reminders as your payment due dates approach. However, if a payment is missed, your ability to make further purchases through Mintpay will be immediately restricted.

How does refunds work | How long do refunds take
How do refunds work?
Refunds depend on the policy of the respective merchant. If a merchant authorises a refund, they must initiate it through their Mintpay merchant portal. Once initiated, you will receive an automated email from Mintpay confirming the start of the refund process. Subsequent instalments linked to that specific purchase will be automatically cancelled.
How long does refund processing take?
Refund processing generally takes about 7-14 business days, depending on your banking partner.
How do partial refunds work?
When a partial refund is processed, the refunded amount is deducted from your pending instalments for that specific purchase. This reduces the remaining balance you will pay from the future instalments for that order.
