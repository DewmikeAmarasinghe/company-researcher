### Frequently Asked Questions
What is Pay Later?

What is a split limit?
The split limit is the maximum credit that Mintpay approves for your 'Pay Later' purchases. This doesn't include your first instalment, which you pay at the point of purchase.
Do I get Cashback on Pay Later purchases?
Yes, you now earn Cashback as Mint Coins when you Pay Later as well. Plus, when you settle your instalments early, you earn even more Mint Coins.
How to increase my split limit?
  * The initial split limit for first-time customers may start small and increase based on your repayment behavior.
  * The longer you transact with Mintpay and make timely repayments, the higher your split limit will be.
  * If you wish to increase your split limit sooner, you can pay off the instalments ahead of time.
  * Increase in the split limit may also be determined by the order amount. Therefore, if you purchase an item with a higher value than your Mintpay approved limit, your subsequent split limit will increase in proportion to this order amount once you have completed all 3 instalments.
