#  **Our Process**
## Resource Outsourcing / Consulting Services
Businesses today need highly functional, high-performance applications and solutions in order to remain competitive. Each year, firms spend billions to upgrade existing systems or develop new systems. However, the high cost of in-house software development makes such efforts prohibitive for many businesses. hSenid development skills are packaged as “development partnerships.” Partnerships can include short-term and long-term projects, partial or complete life-cycle services, analysis and specification design, coding, maintenance, and specific subcontracting services. hSenid offers both onsite and offshore outsourcing services through several models in order to match different scenarios and meet the needs of our clients.
