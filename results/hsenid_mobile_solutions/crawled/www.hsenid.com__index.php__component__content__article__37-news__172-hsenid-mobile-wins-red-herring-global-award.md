**Santa Monica, California – February 2011** - Red Herring announced **hSenid Mobile** as a winner of its “Red Herring Global award” amongst 100 other leading private ICT companies from North America, Europe, and Asia, celebrating their innovations and technologies across their respective industries.
The Red Herring editorial team selected the most innovative companies from a pool of 1200 companies from across the world – the Finalists from its Red Herring Asia, Europe and North America Awards. The nominees are evaluated on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as financial performance, technology innovation, quality of management, execution of strategy, and integration into their respective industries.
This unique assessment of potential is complemented by a review of the actual track record and standing of a company, which allows Red Herring to see past the “buzz” and make the list an important instrument for discovering and advocating the greatest business opportunities in the industry.
Red Herring’s Global 100 list has become a mark of distinction for identifying promising companies and entrepreneurs. Red Herring editors were among the first to recognize that companies such as Google, Skype, Netscape, Salesforce.com, YouTube, eBay and many others would change the way we live and work.
“Choosing the best out of the previous three years was by no means a small feat,” said Alex Vieux, Chairman of Red Herring. “After rigorous contemplation and discussion, we narrowed down our list from 1,200 potential companies to 200 finalists. Trying to get it down to 100 companies was a task upon itself. **hSenid Mobile** should be extremely proud of its achievement, the competition was difficult.”
He also went onto say that "2010 was very difficult but extremely rewarding, despite lingering effects of the global economic situation, there are many great companies producing truly innovative and amazing technologies, to the extent that we had a hard time narrowing the pool, selecting the finalists & then the winners. **hSenid Mobile** shows great promise and therefore deserves to be a worthy winner of this award.  
  
The winners for the award are selected based upon their technological innovation, management strength, market size, investor record, customer acquisition, and financial health. During the several months leading up to the announcement, hundreds of companies in spaces such as mobile, security, Web 2.0, software, hardware, biotech, and clean tech sent in their submissions to qualify for the award.
