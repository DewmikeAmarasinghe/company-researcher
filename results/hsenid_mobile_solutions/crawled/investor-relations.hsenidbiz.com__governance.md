##### Message from the Chairman 
"We started hSenid with just three people out of a small room at Ward Place. From day one, I was determined to build HR solutions for global markets. As an indigenous multinational, we are committed to doing our part in developing the local tech industry. I ensure that while the company grows, we will also divert resources to upskill local tech professionals and help startups get off the ground. We have donated our HR system to universities in the country, with free unlimited access to undergraduate HR students. We lecture at universities and take an active role in developing the curriculum. I am a firm believer in the Sri Lankan people. Like hSenid, others have built global IT companies with the talent available locally. With a collective effort and purposeful training and upskilling, I believe we can propel the IT industry to the next level of sophistication and growth. 
I always envisioned hSenid as a product company rather than a services company. I wanted to build intellectual property and give people an opportunity to become part of something great. When I think of legacy, I think of hSenid as a local company that put Sri Lanka on the world map and opened a world of opportunities for our young people. Today, hSenid Business Solutions employs over 250 people, however, over the last 25 years, we have built over 4,000 tech careers, and our alumni have gone on to do remarkable things and build successful careers here, in Australia and the UK. We are quietly proud of the impact hSenid has had on people's lives, be they employees, customers or subscribers, and the considerable foreign exchange savings we have generated for the country with our HR solutions." 
Dinesh SaparamaduDirector/Chairman, hSenid Business Solutions 
##### Message from the CEO 
"From the inception, our intention was to build world-class HR solutions that would revolutionise the HR profession and make life easy for HR professionals, employers, and employees, and help enterprises unleash their most valuable asset, people. Our focus on user experiences and building HR solutions for a global market quickly attracted attention, and with that came opportunities that opened doors to launch hSenid global. 
We were fortunate to have worked with big local corporations as it gave us unique insights into HR practices and helped us develop innovative solutions that can be scaled globally. From the team point of view, we ensure we have the right people from consulting to engineering, to build a global solution. We benchmarked our products with leading international brands and added new features based on unique customer requirements and considering different industries and geographical contexts. This way, we have built end-to-end HR solutions beyond the rudimentary but complex attendance and payroll functions, including recruitment, talent management and succession planning. We aim to bring the best HR practices to the table, and also the art of giving clients what they need to drive productivity to the next level. 
hSenid is one of the few global tech companies that understand markets and cater to varying needs and ecosystems. While most competitors have one-size-fits-all solutions, our solutions are designed with great care and positioned to generate considerable revenue and we are invested in the process of building a global partner network. Several HR solutions providers serve the Asia Pacific and African regions, and there is no clear leader. We strongly believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to build a global HR solutions brand that can tweak world-class solutions for different contexts and needs, and we believe we can take the lead in these two regions." 
Sampath JayasundaraDirector/CEO, hSenid Business Solutions.
