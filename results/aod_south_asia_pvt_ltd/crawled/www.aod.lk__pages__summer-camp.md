#  Summer Camp 
**Sustainable Fashion Textiles & Supply chain management programme**
This unique international study programme is for students interested in creative textile explorations, supply chain management and sustainable fashion. It offers an intimate view into conscious practices in fashion design, product making and sourcing, via the lens of the South Asian island of Sri Lanka. 
With the curriculum and study experiences built around the island’s artisanal cultures, creative heritage and sustainable manufacturing models that serve as an inspiring case study, a working model and a future production source, this summer programme will help you develop your design approach, advance your knowledge, and immerse yourself in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
The certificate award offered after completion will be a testimony of your ability to consult fashion brands with new knowledge that will give them a special edge, and your place in a sustainable sourcing network for own brands.
The Programme consists of:
  * Talks
  * Workshops
  * Industry Meetings
  * Field Trips
  * Project Reviews
  * Mentorship
  * Work Experience
  * Collection Development


**CORE STUDY EXPERIENCE**
The course is a multifaceted experience, balancing immersive cultural experiences with engagement in sustainable design and making connections with active, global businesses and supply chains. The programme is all about understanding the elements of design quality, bringing in a unique sense of story while building your own personal business network.
At the end of the course you would have a variety of creative outputs linked to specialist workshops conducted during the program and be full of ideas. 
You will show your work and share your experience on the last day of the course.
**SUSTAINABLE DESIGN -** DESIGN RESOURCES + CREATIVE INSPIRATION + STUDIO FACILITIES
**SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT** - UNDERSTANDING THE MAKERS + NETWORKING + LIFETIME CONNECTIONS
**CULTURAL IMMERSIONS** - ARTISANAL HERITAGE + CRAFT TRAILS + CHANGING CULTURES + ISLAND WAY OF DOING THINGS
**A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAKER + STORIES TO INSPIRE YOUR STORY**
One of the most inspiring components of this study programme are the excursions into villages where you meet with artisanal communities who practice traditional crafts.
By directly interacting with artisanal communities, you will gain the much-needed understanding of their skills, capabilities and especially, how this work empowers them. 
Their stories, smiles and skills will become part of what drives your products, brands and practices, bringing in a new dimension of social sustainability to your study.
