**This unique international study programme is for students interested in creative textile explorations, supply chain management and sustainable fashion. It offers an intimate view**
**into conscious practices in fashion design, product making and sourcing, via the lens of the South Asian island of Sri Lanka. With the curriculum and study experiences built around the island’s artisanal cultures, creative heritage and sustainable manufacturing models that serve as an inspiring case study, a working model and a future production source, this summer programme will help you develop your**
**design approach, advance your knowledge, and immerse yourself in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The certificate award offered after completion will be testimony of your ability to consult fashion brands with new knowledge that will give them a special edge, and your place in a sustainable**
**sourcing network for own brands.**
### A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAKER +
###  **STORIES****TO****INSPIRE****YOUR** **STORY**
One of the most inspiring components of this study programme are the excursions into villages where you meet
with artisanal communities who practice traditional crafts. By directly interacting with artisanal communities, you will gain the much-needed understanding of their skills, capabilities and especially, how this work empowers them. Their stories,
smiles and skills will become part of what drives your products, brands and practices, bringing in a new dimension of social sustainability to your study.
### A LIVING, BREATHING HERITAGE + 
### NEED-TO-KNOW CRAFT DYNAMICS
The unusual crafts that Sri Lanka has to offer will be part of this study experience, allowing you to derive a deep understanding of the breadth of possibilities and the scope for innovation, reinvention and experimentation. Going from textile production to unusual printmaking methods, this course’s exposure to crafts will be direct, thought-provoking and immersive in every sense. By facilitating workshops and direct interactions with the crafts, the course will give you sensitivity to the limitations, opportunities and material choices of each craft technique, which will form the critical knowledge base upon which you can go on to experiment and reinvent them with fresh perspectives.

### SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
##### **DESIGN RESOURCES + CREATIVE INSPIRATION + STUDIO FACILITIES**
Your study components in sustainable design are intended to help you open up new dimensions in your formal design education and to help you discover alternative creative inspiration. Think workshops with artisan-designer duos, talks by local entrepreneurs leading own sustainable design practices and collaborative studio environments thick with like-minded creatives and talent.
### SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Programme participants will follow the steps of a working supply chain from direct interactions with micro village designers/weavers to cutting-edge, high- tech sustainable manufacturers, seeing first hand Sri Lanka's award winning green apparel industry produce advanced products for their international clients. These connections will not only advance your knowledge in the essentials of managing supply chains, but also establish valuable networks to establish your own business.
### CULTURAL IMMERSIONS
##### **ARTISANAL HERITAGE + CRAFT TRAILS + CHANGING CULTURES + ISLAND WAY OF DOING THINGS**
The immersive cultural experiences are an important part of crafting a unique study opportunity. These intimate views form the essential backstory creating a unique understanding of a place and its people before beginning to decode its crafts, techniques, production methods, supply chains and businesses. Presented as excursions to artisanal heritage villages amidst breathtaking tropical landscapes, social engagements within urban subcultures, and unique personal experiences, the programme’s rich cultural component will provide a new perspective on working with local professionals in unknown destinations.
