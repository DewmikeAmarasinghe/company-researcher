#  Location 
Colombo Innovation Tower (CIT) is a new kind of epicentre created for South Asia. We are the heart of a network of courageous creatives and innovators. We aim to create impact through design with sustainable innovation and technology running through everything we do.
We were founded by Sri Lanka’s award-winning female entrepreneur Linda Speldewinde, whose idea has resonated with global collaborators who have joined in to realise the project’s potential.
We are part of the Design Corp Group of companies which launches ventures to bridge creative innovation and business. We are powered by AOD - Sri Lanka’s groundbreaking design educator.
A cross-disciplinary mix of brands, industry luminaries, exciting startups, veteran educators, global banks and training programmes are being brought together to create a community of international and local professionals looking at cross-industry collaborations.
