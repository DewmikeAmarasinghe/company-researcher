An award-winning degree hailing from UK’s beloved Northumbria University is one of the most popular programmes here at AOD. This programme helps the students develop their own distinctive signature style and by the time that the students graduate, they will make a significant mark in the world of fashion. This programme follows the same syllabus and content with special references to working in the South Asian context. 
During the programme, the students will get a chance to investigate and experiment with a diverse range of fashion disciplines including womenswear, menswear and knitwear. Once they are ready to choose a specialisation, they will begin crafting their signature style. The final year is where they’ll begin to create, develop and produce their own individual collection for the graduate fashion show.
