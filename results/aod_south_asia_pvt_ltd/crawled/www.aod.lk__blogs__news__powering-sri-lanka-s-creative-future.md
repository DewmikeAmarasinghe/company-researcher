In response to the industry’s growing demand for skilled visual communication specialists, AOD, in collaboration with CIT Labs in Sri Lanka and leading industry design partners, is proud to offer a fully funded and merit-based opportunity for selected candidates to pursue a prestigious British degree in Graphic Design Visual Communication from Northumbria University – Newcastle, UK.
The primary aim of this fully funded programme is to identify and nurture local creative and design talents, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to drive the industry forward and position Sri Lanka as a leading hub for creative industries. By addressing the growing demand for visual communication professionals, AOD is playing a pivotal role in meeting industry needs and creating new opportunities for young talent. This fully funded merit-based programme by AOD offers a lifeline to local creative and design talents amidst Sri Lanka’s current brain drain. Where the rapid departure of skilled individuals threatens the growth of industries, AOD’s initiative with industry partners and CIT Labs stands out as a strategic move to retain and empower deserving talent. By identifying and nurturing these individuals, AOD not only addresses the immediate demand for visual communication professionals but also contributes to long-term industry sustainability. Through this programme, AOD is not just filling a void; it’s shaping the future of Sri Lanka’s creative landscape and fostering economic growth.
Selected candidates will have the opportunity to enrol in the Graphic Design Visual Communication degree program at AOD. The programme, which fulfils the Northumbria University – Newcastle, UK degree curriculum, spans five years. It will be conducted free of charge for the selected candidates. In return, students will commit to working as interns at CIT Labs, starting with five hours a week in the first year and gradually increasing to full-time employment with a monthly allowance by the fourth and fifth years. Upon completion of the degree, they will have accumulated five years of valuable work experience, enhancing their employability both locally and internationally in the design industry.
This fully funded merit-based programme offered by AOD presents a myriad of benefits for aspiring creatives. Firstly, participants receive a 100% free degree from the AOD Campus located in Colombo, Sri Lanka, situated within the Colombo Innovation Tower. This environment fosters an inspiring academic culture, enriched by industry partners and creatives engaging in talks, workshops, and collaborative projects. Moreover, graduates receive a Bachelor’s degree certificate from Northumbria University – Newcastle, a prestigious qualification recognised worldwide. Additionally, participants are encouraged to engage in all extracurricular activities at AOD, enhancing their overall learning experience. Graduates emerge from the programme with five years of invaluable experience in the design industry, coupled with a complete degree. Furthermore, they join a highly sought-after cohort of design professionals in Sri Lanka, enjoying the benefits of heightened demand and higher salary scales that the AOD- Northumbria qualifications demand.
The commencement date for this special cohort is set for March, 2024. This unusual opportunity for learning, growth, industry immersion, and creative exploration has limited spots available.
