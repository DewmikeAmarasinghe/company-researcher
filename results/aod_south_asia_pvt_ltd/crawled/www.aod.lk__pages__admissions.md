#  Entry requirements 
Thanks for considering AOD for your design education, you're in good hands! To apply for Northumbria UK design degrees and other programs conducted at AOD, you can follow our simple application process online or by visiting us in Colombo. You need to have completed the GCE O/L exam for entry to the foundation program and GCE A/L to enter the degree program directly.  
---   
These are our basic guidelines; however, we're open to receive students from all walks of life and therefore reserve the right to consider unusual applicants who may not meet the minimal entry requirements but who, in our opinion, are able to demonstrate an ‘equivalent’ Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) entry level for admission into any course.   
Fluency in English is important because all lectures at AOD are conducted in English and our teaching faculty consists predominantly of international design experts - if you need to improve your English skills, we are able to guide you to suitable program.
