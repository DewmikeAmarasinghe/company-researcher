The creative and design industries are also constantly looking to hire bright young individuals in the creative and design fields and the opportunities for employment are growing every day. As the leading communications group in the country we are encouraged with the role that AOD is playing in helping to meet this need by joining forces with the Northumbria University-School of Design of UK.
