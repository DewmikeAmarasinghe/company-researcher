# Export Market
For more than 150 years, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, as the manufacturer of the iconic Elephant House portfolio of food and beverages, has endeavoured to spread joy and laughter through our longstanding belief in wholesome goodness and nutrition.  
In 1980 we at Elephant House reached beyond Sri Lankan boundaries to reach a global clientele, who share the same enthusiasm for our flavours and trust us to deliver nutrition and goodness. 
Since our first, tentative steps into the international market, 40 years ago, we have transformed the local and global FMCG landscape by setting industry benchmarks in manufacturing and sourcing; maintaining an intricate balance between sustainable industry practices and delivering value to our consumers around the world.
Today we have reached beyond our neighbouring markets, like India and Maldives, and have reached much further afield towards the Middle East including UAE and Qatar, the UK and Europe including France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, and even as far away as Canada and Australia.
### Elephant House Going Global
With our strong push to increase our global footprint, Elephant House is proud of our rapidly advancing progress and status as an international brand that is synonymous with flavorful, wholesome goodness delivered in every sip and bite.   
Our range of beverages and frozen confectionaries including the natural ginger flavoured Elephant House Ginger Beer and our range of naturally flavoured ice creams, in particular, has become highly treasured in foreign markets, shared among family and friends alike at the dining room table.
