  * ## Diversity & Inclusion 
Our overarching approach to managing the human capital is articulated in our ‘People Promises’ which clearly define what all employees can expect from being employed at the Ceylon Cold Stores PLC and reflects our long-term commitment to creating employee value.
As a part of John Keells Holdings PLC, our comprehensive HR policy framework and code of conduct is aligned to that of John Keells Holdings PLC. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on gender, age, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
