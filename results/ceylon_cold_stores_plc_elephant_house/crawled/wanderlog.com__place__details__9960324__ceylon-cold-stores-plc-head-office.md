Complained some time ago regarding some full cream milk that had gone bad before expiry. It took some time, but they came home and replaced it, with some extra for the waiting period. Happy that they acknowledged the long waiting period and took appropriate measures to solve it.
The observation from the last review of NO Taste in drinks is because Ceylon Cold Stores has resorted to using Artificial Sweeteners instead of Sugar. Sweet drink bottles do not name the sweetner but the smaller foil packs use something other than Aspartame. Having gone through the labels of 1L bottles in super markets, I an now looking at getting rid of 30 plus glass bottles, I have at home, as I do not consume artificial sweeteners. The highly sweet Elephant drinks have not got me nor my family diabetic. If I want the genuine sweet drink, I hate the company trying to add sweetners, which are even more toxic, which should not be given to kids.
Huge fan of your Elephant house EGB carbonated drink until very recently i purchased a 500ml drink from a closeby supermarket it turned out to be not the same quality yourl had before had no taste at all. Although i had the medium sugar EGB it had no flavor i had the same experience three in a row!!!!
