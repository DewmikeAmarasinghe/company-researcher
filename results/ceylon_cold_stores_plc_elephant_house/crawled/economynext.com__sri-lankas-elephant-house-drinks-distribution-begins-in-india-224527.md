ECONOMYNEXT – Distribution of Elephant House beverages in India has started, under a partnership struck with Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, Ceylon Cold Stores, a unit of Sri Lanka’s John Keells Holdings said.
A fee-based franchise partnership that was formed in February 2024 with Reliance Consumer Products Limited (RCPL), to manufacture, market, distribute, and sell Elephant House beverages.
“Although the partnership’s contribution to beverage business profitability is minimal at present, it is expected to ramp up as the products gain traction in the Indian market over time,” Ceylon Cold Stores told shareholders in the annual report.
“The partnership with Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) aims to enhance market reach in India, while the Company’s work with suppliers and distributors is expected to support seamless supply chains and reduced credit risk.”
Under the deal Elephant House is exporting carbonated soft drink concentrate to Reliance.
“The unique selling proposition for Elephant House is the similarity of the flavour palate between the Sri Lankan and Indian markets, as sampled through pilot studies,” JKH said.
The agreement between RCPL and Elephant House underscores a shared commitment to excellence and innovation, empowering both organisations to capitalise on synergies and amplify their market presence

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure has signed an agreement with regional plantation companies (RPCs) to increase estate workers’ wages to 1,750 a day, a statement said.
A 2026 Budget proposal was to increase by 400 rupees the current 1,350 rupee daily wage of an estate worker, with the government paying 200 of this. 
This would bring the total daily wage of an estate worker to 1,750 rupees.
The revised wage is be effective from 1 January 2026. 
Opposition members opposed the move as they pointed out that the government would be using public funds to pay private sector wages.
Sri Lanka RPCs are privately managed entities involved in cultivation, production, and processing of tea, rubber, coconut, and cinnamon across estates. 
These include Hayleys Plantations (Kelani Valley, Talawakelle, Horana), Browns Plantations (Maturata, Udapussellawa, Hapugastenne), and Elpitiya Plantations. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)

# Sri Lanka’s private sector credit slows in December: CB official

Friday January 30, 2026 11:00 am
ECONOMYNEXT – Credit to Sri Lanka’s private sector slowed in December after being steady at around 200 billion rupees monthly, a top Central Bank official said, amid an expected slowdown in economic activities after Cyclone Ditwah disaster.
The private credit volumes from commercial banks have slowed to 183 billion rupees in December 2025 from a new high of 262 billion rupees in the previous month.
The 12-month growth in the private sector credit growth also has fallen to 25.2 percent last month, compared to 26 percent in November 2025, official data showed.
“We have seen notable expansion from June onwards by over 200 billion rupees a month, but some slow down observed in December as shown by provisional data to 183 billion,” S. Jegajeevan, Director of the Central Bank’s Economic Research Department told reporters on Wednesday (28).
She did not explain the reason for the slow down, but analysts attribute the slowdown to lower economic activities in December after the disaster late in November.
Jegajeevan said improving demand conditions as well as notable increase in vehicle imports led to strong private credit demand in the second half of 2025 with a slowdown in December. (Colombo/January 30/2026)

“You can see that is continuing this month as well.”
The Central Bank’s dollar purchasing helped it boost foreign currency reserves to 6.8 billion dollars by end 2025. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)

# Sri Lanka may get over U$700mn in IMF double review
Friday January 30, 2026 8:04 am
Friday January 30, 2026 8:04 am
ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund is discussing combining the fifth and sixth reviews of the of the Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka, Mission Chief Evan Papageorgiou said after last review was delayed due to Cyclone Ditwah.
Combining reviews is a “live discussion” he told reporters in Colombo after concluding a mission to assess the impact of Cyclone Ditwah.
Sri Lanka’s President’s media office said discussions related the of “the sixth tranche under the programme would resume in March.”
Each review leads to the disbursement of 254 million special drawing rights (about 371 million dollars) at the current exchange rates making the total about 720 million US dollars if two reviews were completed together.
The staff level agreement and targets for Sri Lanka’s planned fifth review under the Extended Fund Facility in December 2025 became obsolete after spending in a budget for 2025 was increased by 500 billion rupees and economic projections became uncertain.
The fifth review was to be conducted on the fiscal and monetary targets applicable for June 2025.
However, by March 2026, December targets would be available, under the applicable program before the staff level for the fifth review.
Sri Lanka has kept most quantitative targets for June and December, emerging data show.
Sri Lanka’s reserve collections reduced after a May rate cut and insufficient deflationary policy (sell downs of central bank held domestic assets) and unsterilized over-purchases led to currency depreciation.

However, in December cyclone Ditwah has may have reduced domestic credit, which then leads falling interest rates to a reduction in imports in the ensuing weeks helping build reserves. 
Credit came to a standstill in 2004 after the tsunami struck the island.
There were also foreign inflows as Ditwah aid which can strengthen the currency if the central bank did not buy them to create new money and was allowed to hit the market. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)
