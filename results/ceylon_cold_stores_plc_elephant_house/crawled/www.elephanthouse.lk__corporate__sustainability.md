# Sustainability & CSR
As the leading food & beverage company in Sri Lanka, CCS strives to deliver our goodness and health to our consumers everywhere. In the process, we also make sure that our products are made with care and responsibility, to our environment and the people who power our sourcing and manufacturing process. 
## Sustainable Sourcing 
At CCS, preserving the delicate natural and social balance is a vital part of ensuring the sustainable growth of our business
We respect our planet’s resources, and responsibly sourcing of our raw materials is an essential part of our production process.
The benefits of sustainable sourcing are quite clear; It allows us to reduce our business risk and volatility in the chain of supply of raw material to our production lines, whilst building mutually beneficial relationships throughout our supply chain and providing supplier communities with opportunities to be more successful in their livelihood. 
At Elephant House, our duty extends beyond the production of consumer products. As a responsible corporate citizen, we strive to create a greener country and world for our future generations by engaging more sustainable and eco-friendly practices which in the long run will be one of our biggest offerings to our consumers
