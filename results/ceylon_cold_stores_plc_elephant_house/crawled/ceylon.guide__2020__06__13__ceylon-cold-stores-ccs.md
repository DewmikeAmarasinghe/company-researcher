Ceylon Cold Stores (CCS), trading as Elephant House, is a Sri Lankan company which produces carbonated drinks, ice cream and processed meat products. Despite competition from global competitors such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Elephant Soft Drinks remains the market leader in Sri Lanka.
With a history stretching as far back as 1866, the origins of the Ceylon Cold Stores are rooted in the Colombo Ice Company. Founded by a German engineer, Arthur Von Possner the Colombo Ice Company began production of ice on a commercial scale, gradually gaining a reputation that the district would soon be officially referred to as the Kompaniveediya.
Colombo Ice Company imported the country’s first ice-making machine in 1863. With an initial capital of £1,900, two steam engines of 8 and 9 horse power, and a total of 22 employees, the company started producing ice on a commercial scale. The company’s first premises were located on Glennie Street, Slave Island and its popular name _Ice Kompaniya_ was used locally to identify the area, Kompaniveediya.

The Colombo Ice Company acquired the medical hall of J Maitland, home to a variety of mediated wines and introduced aerated water with the distinctive “Elephant” trademark on the bottle, which later became “Elephant House” and since that time has remained as the household name for the brand. The company initially produced two types of carbonated drinks: soda and lemonade, both of which compared favorably at the time in international fairs in Melbourne and Calcutta, where they won awards.

The company, however, went into liquidation. Tom Walker, owner of a competing aerated water company purchased Colombo Ice Company, headed a syndicate that bought Colombo Ice Company, forming a new company under the name **New Colombo Ice Company** on 8 May 1894. He was the first managing director of the New Colombo Ice Company Limited.
In 1910 the New Colombo Ice Company bought the business and plant of one of its main competitors, the Galle Face Ice Company, from J. P. Motten for Rs. 45,000. In 1919, the company acquired Von Possner’s British Aerated and Mineral Water Company for Rs. 175,000.

In 1923, the company purchased a new ice manufacturing plant which was driven by an internal combustion engine replacing its old ten-ton steam-driven plant. By 1925, the company moved on to build cold storage for frozen products of all kinds, opening new cold stores in Colombo on 1 December 1928. The same year the company purchased another smaller rival, the Pure Ice and Aerated Waters Manufactory.
In 1932, Ceylon Creameries Limited was acquired to produce and distribute reconstituted fresh milk and ice cream. Ice Cream in bulk form was produced in four-gallon buckets.

Having evolved with changing times and consumer patterns, including the end of British colonial rule, a bitterly fought world war, the industry nationalisation policy of local governments, and an open economy, Ceylon Cold Stores has come a long way from its humble beginnings as an ice and mineral water manufacturing company, meeting the challenges launched by global food and beverage giants within the food and beverage market in Sri Lanka.
