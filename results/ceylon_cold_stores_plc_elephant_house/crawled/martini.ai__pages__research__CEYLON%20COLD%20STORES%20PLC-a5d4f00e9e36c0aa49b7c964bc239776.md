Company Background
How does this company make money — and where could it break?
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS) is a leading Sri Lankan consumer goods manufacturer and retailer, well-known for its iconic Elephant House brand. Established over a century ago, CCS operates primarily in two segments: manufacturing and supermarkets. The manufacturing segment produces a wide range of beverages, ice creams, and other consumer staples, while the supermarket segment operates retail outlets across Sri Lanka. The company is publicly listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and has a significant market presence in the consumer staples sector, contributing substantially to Sri Lanka's FMCG industry. CCS has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, with its fiscal year 2025 revenue reaching approximately LKR 156.81 billion, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase. Despite challenges such as inflationary pressures, currency volatility, and supply chain disruptions, CCS has maintained profitability and a strong brand reputation, supported by effective cost management and operational resilience. The company’s financial position includes total assets of LKR 77.5 billion and equity of LKR 22.7 billion as of mid-2025, although it reported a negative cash position due to bank overdrafts, indicating some liquidity pressures.12345[Regarding the default probability trends from January 2022 to December 2025, CCS experienced significant fluctuations in credit risk. The default probability rose sharply from 0.148 in January 2022 to a peak of 0.331 in July 2022, coinciding with a period of macroeconomic instability in Sri Lanka marked by currency depreciation, inflation spikes, and supply chain challenges affecting the consumer staples sector broadly. Following this peak, the default probability declined to 0.215 by December 2023, reflecting partial recovery as the company and sector adapted to economic conditions. However, the risk increased again towards the end of the period, stabilizing near the initial level of 0.148 by December 2025. This pattern suggests that while CCS faced financial stress during 2022, it managed to stabilize its credit risk through operational resilience and market position, though vulnerabilities remain due to ongoing economic uncertainties in Sri Lanka.5](https://www.keells.com/resource/reports/group-annual-reports/Ceylon-Cold-Stores-PLC-Annual-Report-24-25.pdf)

Probability of Default
Compare current PD to historical stress periods
The credit risk profile of CEYLON COLD STORES PLC, a prominent Sri Lankan consumer goods manufacturer known for its Elephant House brand, has exhibited notable volatility between January 2022 and December 2025, as indicated by its default probability [martini.ai]. Beginning with a default probability of 0.148 in January 2022, the company's credit risk escalated significantly, peaking at 0.331 in July 2022 [martini.ai]. This surge in default probability coincided with a period of considerable macroeconomic instability in Sri Lanka, characterized by currency depreciation, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions that broadly impacted the consumer staples sector in which CEYLON COLD STORES PLC operates 5. Given that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC is a leading player in Sri Lanka's FMCG industry, these external economic pressures likely strained its financial performance, contributing to the increased perception of credit risk.

Subsequently, the default probability of CEYLON COLD STORES PLC decreased to 0.215 by December 2023, signaling a partial recovery in its credit standing [martini.ai]. This improvement likely reflects the company's adaptation to the challenging economic conditions, leveraging its strong brand reputation and implementing effective cost management strategies 1. CEYLON COLD STORES PLC has historically demonstrated operational resilience, which would have been crucial in navigating the economic headwinds during this period. However, this positive trend proved to be temporary, as the default probability experienced another increase, ultimately reaching 0.148 by December 2025 [martini.ai]. Despite this increase, the default probability for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC concluded near its initial level, suggesting a stabilization of its credit risk profile [martini.ai]. This stabilization may be attributed to the company's consistent revenue growth and its established market presence, which helped to mitigate the impact of ongoing economic uncertainties in Sri Lanka 2.
In conclusion, the default probability trends for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC reveal a period of financial stress in 2022, followed by a partial recovery and eventual stabilization [martini.ai]. While the company's risk of default did not substantially worsen from its initial state, the observed fluctuations highlight underlying vulnerabilities in its financial health [martini.ai]. The absence of a consistent downward trend in default probability suggests that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC may still encounter challenges in bolstering its long-term credit standing [martini.ai]. Despite reporting substantial revenue and maintaining a significant market presence, the fluctuations in default probability underscore the need for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC to address its liquidity pressures, as indicated by its negative cash position, to ensure sustained financial stability and creditworthiness 6.

It rose from 0.148 in January 2022 to a peak of 0.331 in July 2022, coinciding with macroeconomic instability in Sri Lanka [martini.ai]. Subsequently, it decreased to 0.215 by December 2023, reflecting a partial recovery, before stabilizing near its initial level by December 2025 [martini.ai].

### Financial Summary
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC exhibited robust financial performance in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, with total revenue reaching approximately LKR 156.81 billion, marking a 13.02% year-over-year increase. This growth was fueled by strong contributions from both its manufacturing and supermarket divisions. The company's Q1 2025 revenue stood at LKR 43.2 billion, reflecting a 13% increase compared to Q1 2024, underscoring consistent sales momentum [martini.ai]. Despite these gains, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC experienced a 7% decline in net profit for Q1 2025, which amounted to LKR 1.09 billion, primarily due to elevated operational costs. However, the full-year net profit demonstrated improvement, with a reported figure of LKR 5.96 billion [martini.ai].
Profitability metrics for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC reveal a nuanced picture. The net profit margin is estimated to be around 3.8%, derived from reported figures, indicating moderate profitability relative to revenue [martini.ai]. While specific values for return on assets and equity were not explicitly stated, the company's efficient asset utilization and shareholder returns are implied by its overall financial performance. Liquidity presented a challenge, as evidenced by a negative cash and cash equivalents balance of LKR 6.7 billion, attributed to bank overdrafts [martini.ai]. Nevertheless, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC maintained strong operating cash flow, which reached LKR 14.95 billion for the year, providing a buffer against liquidity pressures [martini.ai]. The profit before tax for Q1 was LKR 1.76 billion, a 2% increase [martini.ai].
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC demonstrated moderate leverage ratios, supported by a total equity of LKR 22.7 billion and total assets of LKR 77.5 billion [martini.ai]. The company's debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios were manageable, reflecting a balanced capital structure. The interest coverage ratio was adequate, with finance costs paid at LKR 1.08 billion and finance income received at LKR 69 million, indicating the company's ability to service its debt obligations effectively [martini.ai]. Efficiency ratios, such as asset turnover and inventory turnover, aligned with sector norms, further supported by robust sales growth.
Overall, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC exhibited a stable creditworthiness profile, characterized by steady revenue growth, controlled leverage, and resilient cash flows, despite macroeconomic challenges in Sri Lanka. Although specific credit ratings and beta were not disclosed, market analysis suggests a low probability of default for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC. The company's free cash flow and cash flow to debt ratios indicate sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, reinforcing its financial stability [martini.ai].
### Capital Structure, Regulatory, and M&A Assessment
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC maintains a debt structure that reflects a balanced approach to leverage and liquidity management as of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 [martini.ai]. The company demonstrates prudent use of debt financing, supported by a moderate debt-to-equity ratio. This is evidenced by total equity of LKR 22.7 billion against total assets of LKR 77.5 billion [martini.ai]. While specific debt-to-EBITDA ratios are not explicitly reported, the overall financial health suggests effective management of debt relative to earnings.
The interest coverage ratio for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC appears sufficient, indicating the company's ability to comfortably service its debt obligations [martini.ai]. Finance costs paid amounted to approximately LKR 1.08 billion, which is well-supported by the company's operating earnings [martini.ai]. This level of coverage provides a buffer against potential fluctuations in earnings or interest rates, reinforcing the stability of the company's debt servicing capacity.
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC exhibits strong debt servicing capacity and liquidity, driven by robust cash flow from operations, which reached LKR 14.95 billion [martini.ai]. This substantial cash flow provides the company with the financial flexibility to meet its short-term obligations, despite a negative cash and cash equivalents position due to bank overdrafts. The ability to generate significant cash from its operations underscores the company's financial resilience and its capacity to manage its debt obligations effectively.
The absence of detailed public disclosures regarding the maturity profile of Ceylon Cold Stores PLC's debt is mitigated by the company's stable interest coverage and the absence of any indications of defaults [martini.ai]. This suggests that the company's upcoming maturities are manageable. The debt composition likely includes a mix of short-term bank borrowings and longer-term liabilities, which is consistent with sector norms in Sri Lanka. The overall credit outlook for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC remains positive, supported by steady revenue growth, improving profitability, and effective cash flow management.
**Regulatory Lawsuits**
Based on available news sources and company disclosures, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC has not been involved in any publicly reported lawsuits in the recent financial year. There are no records indicating ongoing or past legal disputes that would materially affect the company's financial or operational status. This absence of litigation suggests a stable legal and operational environment for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, allowing it to focus on its core business activities without the distraction and potential financial burden of legal challenges. The lack of legal entanglements supports a positive view of the company's risk profile, as it avoids potential liabilities and reputational damage that could arise from legal disputes.
**Merger and Acquisition Activities**
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC has not announced or filed any reports regarding mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures. This suggests that the company has maintained its existing business structure without engaging in significant corporate restructuring or expansion through M&A activities. The absence of M&A activity indicates a focus on organic growth and internal development, which can be seen as a conservative approach to business expansion. While M&A can provide opportunities for rapid growth and market diversification, it also carries inherent risks related to integration, valuation, and execution. Ceylon Cold Stores PLC's decision to abstain from M&A activities reflects a strategic choice to prioritize stability and controlled growth within its existing market segments.
**Tariff Impacts**
While Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic environment has faced inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, there is no direct evidence that tariff changes have materially affected Ceylon Cold Stores PLC's cost structure or pricing strategies. The company’s financial reports and market analyses do not highlight tariff-related challenges or government trade policy responses impacting its operations. This suggests that Ceylon Cold Stores PLC has been able to navigate the macroeconomic challenges without significant adverse effects from tariff changes. The company's ability to maintain stable operations despite external economic pressures indicates effective risk management and adaptability in its supply chain and pricing strategies.
In summary, the absence of litigation, M&A activity, or tariff-related issues indicates a stable operational environment for Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, allowing it to focus on organic growth and market presence within the consumer staples sector. This stability contributes to a positive credit risk assessment, as it reduces potential sources of financial and operational disruption. The company's focus on internal growth and efficient management of external economic factors supports a view of sustained performance and financial health.
### Bankruptcy Details
Ceylon Cold Stores PLC demonstrates a strong and stable financial history, with no indications of past bankruptcy, default, or significant credit risk events. An analysis of available historical news, financial filings, and market reports reveals a consistent pattern of effective financial management and sustained revenue growth, reinforcing the company's robust credit profile. The absence of any records pertaining to bankruptcy filings, restructuring initiatives, or default notices in publicly accessible sources further supports this assessment. This track record of financial stability enhances investor confidence and bolsters Ceylon Cold Stores PLC's ongoing operations within Sri Lanka's consumer staples sector. As such, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC exhibits no association with any bankruptcy or credit distress events, underscoring its reliability and resilience in the market.

CEYLON COLD STORES PLC exhibits a fluctuating credit spread profile over the analyzed period, reflecting the broader macroeconomic challenges impacting the consumer staples sector in Sri Lanka [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. The average Z-spread for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC ranged from a minimum of 0.322% to a maximum of 17.746%, with the average spread generally maintained between 1.5% and 3.5% [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. The noticeable increase in the maximum spread values towards the end of the observed period indicates heightened volatility in the credit market's perception of risk associated with CEYLON COLD STORES PLC, potentially driven by inflationary pressures, currency volatility, and supply chain disruptions prevalent in Sri Lanka [https://firstcapital.lk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCS-Earnings-Update-MAINTAIN-BUY-12-08-25.pdf]. The letter ratings also show some variation, ranging from A3 to B3, reflecting changes in the perceived credit quality over time [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776].

When compared to its peers in the beverages and retail supermarkets microsector, CEYLON COLD STORES PLC generally maintains lower credit spreads than some companies, which have average spreads often exceeding 3% and letter ratings typically in the B3-B4 range [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. In contrast, other companies exhibit spread levels more closely aligned with CEYLON COLD STORES PLC, though with less pronounced spikes in maximum spread values [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. This relative stability may be attributed to CEYLON COLD STORES PLC's strong brand equity and potentially diversified product portfolio, which are key factors supporting better credit quality within the consumer staples sector [https://firstcapital.lk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCS-Earnings-Update-MAINTAIN-BUY-12-08-25.pdf].
During periods of market stress, such as in late 2024 and early 2025, many peer companies experienced significant widening in their credit spreads, reflecting broader concerns about default risk across the sector [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. The fact that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC demonstrated less pronounced spikes during these times suggests a degree of resilience, possibly due to more effective risk management or stronger financial fundamentals compared to some peers [https://firstcapital.lk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCS-Earnings-Update-MAINTAIN-BUY-12-08-25.pdf].
The credit spreads and ratings suggest that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC is perceived as having relatively better credit quality compared to some of its counterparts, but similar to others [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. This potentially translates to lower borrowing costs for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC relative to the former, and a more favorable market perception [https://firstcapital.lk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCS-Earnings-Update-MAINTAIN-BUY-12-08-25.pdf]. However, the increased volatility and widening spreads observed towards the end of the period warrant close monitoring, as they could signal emerging concerns about the company's financial health or broader macroeconomic factors impacting its creditworthiness [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Given the sector's sensitivity to currency fluctuations and inflation, vigilant risk management is crucial for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC to maintain its credit profile amidst ongoing macroeconomic headwinds [https://firstcapital.lk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CCS-Earnings-Update-MAINTAIN-BUY-12-08-25.pdf].

What’s the main takeaway from this section?
Company Risk Momentum
What signals explain this momentum?
CEYLON COLD STORES PLC (CCS) is currently demonstrating positive credit momentum, indicated by a spread tightening of -0.172 [martini.ai]. This suggests an improvement in market sentiment regarding CEYLON COLD STORES PLC’s creditworthiness, signaling that investors perceive a reduced risk of default. This spread tightening is a leading indicator that the credit risk trend for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC is improving, making it a noteworthy signal for credit analysts monitoring the company's financial health.

When compared to its peers, CEYLON COLD STORES PLC's credit momentum, as measured by spread change, reveals a nuanced picture [martini.ai]. While CEYLON COLD STORES PLC shows a tightening of -0.172, other companies in the sector have demonstrated stronger improvements [martini.ai]. For instance, Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC, a major player in Sri Lanka's alcoholic beverage market, experienced a spread tightening of -0.194 [martini.ai]. Lion Brewery shares exposure to consumer staples demand and macroeconomic factors affecting Sri Lanka, making it comparable from a credit risk perspective due to sectoral and market overlap [3][5]. Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka, a direct competitor in the non-alcoholic beverage segment, saw an even more significant tightening of -0.224 [martini.ai]. This company is highly similar to CCS in product offerings and market dynamics, competing for similar consumer bases [3][5]. Both companies are subject to similar supply chain, currency, and inflationary pressures, making their credit risk profiles closely linked to sectoral trends [3][5]. This comparison suggests that while CEYLON COLD STORES PLC is on a positive trajectory, it is not leading its most relevant peer group in terms of credit improvement.
Overall, the credit risk trend for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC reflects a positive, albeit moderate, shift in market sentiment [martini.ai]. The observed spread tightening aligns with potentially favorable sector outlook, as investors may be gaining confidence in the stability and growth prospects of the broader beverage industry in Sri Lanka [martini.ai]. Given that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC and Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka compete directly in the non-alcoholic beverage segment, the slightly stronger credit improvement in Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka could indicate a shift in investor preference or perceived competitive advantage. Similarly, Lion Brewery's performance, while in a different segment of the beverage market, provides a broader view of investor confidence in the consumer staples sector in Sri Lanka. Monitoring how CEYLON COLD STORES PLC sustains this credit momentum relative to these key peers will be crucial for assessing its long-term credit health.

External Impact
Which external risks are improving vs worsening?
CEYLON COLD STORES PLC's credit risk profile is subject to various macroeconomic factors, with notable sensitivities to the S&P 500 index and the US Dollar exchange rate [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Analysis indicates that CEYLON COLD STORES PLC has a negative exposure of -0.046 to the S&P 500 (SPY), suggesting that an increase in the S&P 500 is likely to result in a narrowing of the company's credit spread, thereby improving its creditworthiness [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. This implies that a rising US equity market tends to improve the creditworthiness of CEYLON COLD STORES PLC.

Conversely, CEYLON COLD STORES PLC exhibits a positive exposure of 0.032 to the US Dollar (TWEXBGSMTH), indicating that a strengthening US Dollar could lead to a widening of its credit spread, potentially increasing its credit risk [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. This sensitivity likely reflects the company's exposure to foreign currency risks, as Sri Lanka’s import costs and debt servicing may be affected by USD fluctuations. Given the current global monetary policy tightening, the US Dollar has remained relatively strong, which could exert pressure on CEYLON COLD STORES PLC and the broader consumer staples sector in Sri Lanka by increasing import costs and inflationary pressures [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776].
The exposures of CEYLON COLD STORES PLC to oil prices and inflation are comparatively smaller, but still relevant [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Inflation in Sri Lanka has been elevated, driven by currency depreciation and supply chain disruptions, further impacting operational costs for companies like CEYLON COLD STORES PLC [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Oil prices, while less impactful, influence transportation and production costs, adding to cost pressures.
Looking ahead, macroeconomic trends could significantly influence the credit profile of CEYLON COLD STORES PLC [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Given its negative exposure to the S&P 500, a sustained equity market downturn could adversely affect the company's creditworthiness, leading to wider credit spreads. The S&P 500’s performance is a proxy for global economic sentiment; any downturn could reduce investor confidence and liquidity, indirectly affecting emerging market companies such as CEYLON COLD STORES PLC [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776]. Simultaneously, continued strength in the US Dollar, possibly driven by shifts in global monetary policy, might further pressure CEYLON COLD STORES PLC's credit metrics. Overall, CEYLON COLD STORES PLC's macro-driven credit profile appears vulnerable to adverse movements in both equity markets and currency valuations. The interplay of a strong US Dollar, inflationary environment, and global equity market trends are key macroeconomic factors shaping the credit risk landscape for CEYLON COLD STORES PLC and its sector, necessitating careful monitoring of these variables for credit risk assessment [https://martini.ai/pages/research/CEYLON%20COLD%20STORES%20PLC-a5d4f00e9e36c0aa49b7c964bc239776].

Why do spreads differ across maturities?
Speedway Motorsports, operating within the consumer discretionary sector, specifically in leisure, exhibits a credit spread of 0.8% [bonds]. However, its business model, which is sensitive to discretionary spending, differs significantly from Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), which operates in the consumer staples sector. The cyclical nature of the leisure industry introduces credit risk dynamics that are not directly comparable to the more stable demand typically associated with consumer staples.

The automotive industry's credit risk factors, influenced by manufacturing costs, supply chain complexities, and consumer preferences for durable goods, bear little resemblance to the dynamics affecting Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS) in the consumer staples sector.
BBK (Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait), a financial institution, exhibits a credit spread of 1.3% [bonds]. As a bank, its credit risk is intrinsically linked to the banking sector's regulatory environment, interest rate fluctuations, and loan portfolio quality, which are fundamentally different from the factors influencing Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS) in the consumer staples sector.
Martin Midstream Partners L.P., operating in the oil & gas midstream sector, has a credit spread of 2.7% [bonds]. This company's credit risk is heavily influenced by commodity prices and the capital-intensive nature of the energy sector, making it a poor comparison to Ceylon Cold Stores PLC (CCS), which operates in the consumer staples sector and is driven by consumer demand and domestic economic conditions in Sri Lanka.
