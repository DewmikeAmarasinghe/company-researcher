With a history stretching as far back as 1866, the origins of the Ceylon Cold Stores are rooted in the Colombo Ice Company. Founded by a German Engineer, Arthur Von Possner the Colombo Ice Company began production of ice on a commercial scale gradually gaining a reputation that the district would soon be officially referred to as the Kompaniveediya.
Since its inception, the Colombo Ice Company has been instrumental in upscaling Sri Lanka’s infantile beverage and frozen confectionery industry introducing new products, packaging, production and storage methods throughout the last one and half centuries.
Having evolved with changing times and consumer patterns, including the end of British Colonial rule, a bitterly fought world war, the industry nationalisation policy of local governments, and an open economy, Ceylon Cold Stores has come a long way from its humble beginnings as an ice and mineral water manufacturing company, meeting the challenges launched by global food and beverage giants within the food and beverage market in Sri Lanka.
