# Accolades and Awards
Over the years, Ceylon Cold Stores PLC has won plenty of awards and accolades for their manufacturing, marketing, and branding excellence. Our visionary leadership, highly talented workforce across diverse business sectors; our core values, strong work ethics, and technology infrastructure have been the major influencing factors behind our uninterrupted and unrivalled success both locally and globally.
However, we don’t let any of these coveted awards lull us into complacency; nor do we ever assume ourselves on the zenith with no space for improvement. While we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, we at CCS seek to keep improving ourselves further and evolving in keeping with the times.
