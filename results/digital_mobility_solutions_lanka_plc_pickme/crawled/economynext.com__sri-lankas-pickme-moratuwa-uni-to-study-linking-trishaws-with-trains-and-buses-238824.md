ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Pick Met, a ride hailing company said it had tied up with the university to study and find solutions to communities who are facing difficulties in accessing transport and also looking at multi-modal transport.
“The collaboration aims to address long-ignored mobility challenges across diverse segments of the population,” the company said in a statement.
“With a population of 22 million people facing a wide range of mobility needs, from rural villages with unmarked roads to urban centres with complex traffic dynamics, PickMe and the University of Moratuwa are seeking to design scalable, locally relevant solutions.” 
“This includes tackling issues such as optimising transport in areas with limited GPS-based map coverage, designing user interfaces for low-literacy communities…”
**Multi-modal**
Moratuwa University and PickMe would also look at integrating “integrating multiple modes of transport, such as buses, trains, and three-wheelers into a unified mobility ecosystem through technology.”
The results could “redefine the future of homegrown technology innovation in the country” by developing solutions designed specifically for the Sri Lankan context, the firm said.
PickMe has information which needs to be better analyzed to determine the evolving needs of the public, Chief Executive Jiffry Zulfer.
“What we require now is qualitative analysis and research, and this is where universities like Moratuwa can play a vital role,” he said.
“We need the human element: the ability to dig deeper into the behavioural patterns of society, to bring innovative thinking, and to help us understand the directions in which citizens of Sri Lanka are seeking solutions to improve their lives.”
The partnership allows advanced research without PickMe having spend on a separate Research and Development division, while the Moratuwa university benefits from real-world application for its academic work.
“This initiative empowers our students to explore future mobility solutions while strengthening Sri Lanka’s technological advancement journey,” Niles Perera, Head, Department of Transport Management & Logistics Engineering, University of Moratuwa said in the statement. (Colombo/Aug31/2025)

Friday January 30, 2026 11:53 am
ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure has signed an agreement with regional plantation companies (RPCs) to increase estate workers’ wages to 1,750 a day, a statement said.
A 2026 Budget proposal was to increase by 400 rupees the current 1,350 rupee daily wage of an estate worker, with the government paying 200 of this. 
This would bring the total daily wage of an estate worker to 1,750 rupees.
The revised wage is be effective from 1 January 2026. 
Opposition members opposed the move as they pointed out that the government would be using public funds to pay private sector wages.
Sri Lanka RPCs are privately managed entities involved in cultivation, production, and processing of tea, rubber, coconut, and cinnamon across estates. 
These include Hayleys Plantations (Kelani Valley, Talawakelle, Horana), Browns Plantations (Maturata, Udapussellawa, Hapugastenne), and Elpitiya Plantations. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)

# Sri Lanka’s private sector credit slows in December: CB official

Friday January 30, 2026 11:00 am
ECONOMYNEXT – Credit to Sri Lanka’s private sector slowed in December after being steady at around 200 billion rupees monthly, a top Central Bank official said, amid an expected slowdown in economic activities after Cyclone Ditwah disaster.
The private credit volumes from commercial banks have slowed to 183 billion rupees in December 2025 from a new high of 262 billion rupees in the previous month.
The 12-month growth in the private sector credit growth also has fallen to 25.2 percent last month, compared to 26 percent in November 2025, official data showed.
“We have seen notable expansion from June onwards by over 200 billion rupees a month, but some slow down observed in December as shown by provisional data to 183 billion,” S. Jegajeevan, Director of the Central Bank’s Economic Research Department told reporters on Wednesday (28).
She did not explain the reason for the slow down, but analysts attribute the slowdown to lower economic activities in December after the disaster late in November.
Jegajeevan said improving demand conditions as well as notable increase in vehicle imports led to strong private credit demand in the second half of 2025 with a slowdown in December. (Colombo/January 30/2026)
