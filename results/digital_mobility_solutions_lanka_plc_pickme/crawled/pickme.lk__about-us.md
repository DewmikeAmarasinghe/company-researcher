## Our journey
Our brief history is the brief history of technology disrupting Sri Lanka’s transport sector – for the commuter, for the driver, for the better.  
  
It was June of 2014 and Zulfer Jiffry had resigned from his post as CTO at wow.lk, Sri Lanka’s largest e-commerce player, and was itching for his next entrepreneurial journey.   
Zulfer arrived at a glaring market opportunity: the transport sector in Sri Lanka was obsolete and required urgent disrupting. Technology was available and more technologically-mature markets had demonstrated how the transport-sector could be overhauled to meet the needs of modern citizens.
After months of development, the prototype for what would eventually become the PickMe app was ready. Zulfer successfully attracted early investment from Ajit Gunewardene, Ruchi Gunewardene, Interblocks Limited and LOLC Technology Services Limited.  
Then, Digital Mobility Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., was formed. Immediately more investors expressed interest, leading to MAS Holdings and Hirdaramani Group of Companies coming onboard as institutional investors subsequently.

## Our Impact
HOW IS GOING GREEN THE SMARTER, SAFER AND FASTER WAY TO COMMUTE?  
  
PickMe is sensitive to the impact of any large-scale transport operations on the environment. It is why we are constantly studying the data generated on our platform to learn new insights into why congestion happens, for instance – and what we can do to help ease it.  
  
Data scientists at PickMe continuously process a mine of local intelligence that enables PickMe Mission Control to direct drivers to regions of the city that most require it – this reduces the aimless driving around driver's resort to in order to find more hires.
Further, a pathbreaking new fee structure is helping commuters see ride-sharing as an affordable alternative to owning a vehicle. Once again, this reduces the need for vehicles with single passengers clogging the roads and polluting our cities – essentially, we believe the PickMe platform has made it affordable to choose the green option when commuting.
