PickMe Flash is a concept formulated to use the existing dependable fleet to pick parcels from point A and deliver to point B at a reasonable cost. This on-demand solution strips away all the complexities that are associated with courier services and allows a simplified delivery solution, that saves plenty of time, energy, and money.  
  
What started off with a fleet of bikes delivering parcels, grew exponentially into expanding PickMe Flash and introducing Flash L for deliveries with tuks and Flash XL for cars. PickMe Flash is a revolutionary, cost-efficient mobile solution that has redefined the commercial platform for delivering goods and parcels in Sri Lanka.
