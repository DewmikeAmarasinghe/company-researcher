A new ride-hailing company has entered the Sri Lankan industry, increasing the number to three from two earlier – PickMe an Uber.
The new facility is being promoted by David Pieris Group and Helakuru partner to introduce HelaGo, a new era in fair ride-hailing.
A statement on Sunday by the David Pieris Group, said that HelaGo, launched under the Helakuru Superapp ecosystem by Bhasha Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, is designed as a “fair and open” ride-hailing platform that empowers both drivers and passengers. It introduces a fresh economic model to the industry, one that moves away from top-down, algorithmically controlled pricing and instead fosters a transparent, demand-and-supply–driven environment.
In HelaGo, fares naturally reflect real market conditions at a micro level, giving drivers the opportunity to earn fairly within a reasonable range while allowing passengers to make informed choices that suit their needs. By restoring balance, transparency and mutual consent to the core of the ride-hailing experience, HelaGo aims to create a more sustainable and equitable mobility ecosystem for Sri Lanka, the statement said.
The platform supports multiple payment methods including cash, card and HelaPay—the integrated digital wallet within the Helakuru ecosystem—ensuring simple and secure transactions. With millions of existing Helakuru users, HelaGo is strongly positioned for rapid nationwide adoption, bridging affordability, accessibility and fairness to create a more inclusive mobility experience.
