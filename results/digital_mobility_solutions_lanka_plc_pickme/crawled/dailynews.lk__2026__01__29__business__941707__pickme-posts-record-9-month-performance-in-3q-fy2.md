Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC (PickMe) delivered a resilient operational and financial performance in the third quarter of the financial year 2025/26 (3QFY26), sustaining strong growth momentum over the first nine months of the year and reinforcing its leadership in Sri Lanka’s digital mobility ecosystem.

The Company recorded a revenue of Rs. 6.2 billion for the first nine months of FY25/26, representing a 50% year-on-year increase from Rs. 4.1 billion in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. Growth was driven by record user engagement, an expanding supply base, and increased activity across all service verticals, validating the effectiveness of PickMe’s platform-led strategy.
Overall platform activity increased 47% year-on-year during the first nine-months, driving a 46% increase in Gross Transaction Value (GTV) to Rs. 59.5 billion, up from Rs. 40.7 billion in the prior year. This sustained growth in trips and deliveries reinforces PickMe’s role as an essential digital utility and a vital income-generation platform. Notably, average monthly ride hailing driver earnings on the platform has increased by 14% compared to the same period last year, highlighting the growing economic opportunity for the Company’s community of third party driver earners.
Supported by strong top-line growth, improved operating leverage, and disciplined cost management, operating profit for the first nine months of FY25/26 increased 93% year-on-year to Rs. 2.1 billion, compared to Rs. 1.1 billion in the previous year. Net profit rose 89% to Rs. 1.5 billion, reflecting the Company’s ability to scale efficiently while delivering robust bottom-line growth.
Revenue for the third quarter of FY25/26 reached Rs. 2.3 billion, a 48% year-on-year increase from Rs. 1.5 billion recorded in the same quarter last year. This performance was achieved despite temporary disruptions caused by Cyclone Ditwah in late November 2025. While regions outside the Western Province were significantly affected, activity returned to pre-cyclone levels within two weeks. Strong seasonal demand in the Western Province offset the decline in the Central Province, which was the most impacted region.
Founder and CEO of PickMe, Jiffry Zulfer, said, “Strong user engagement and consistent execution across our platform enabled us to deliver resilient growth this quarter, even in the face of external disruptions. We remain focused on scaling responsibly while delivering dependable value to users, earners, and shareholders.”
Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, “These results reflect a disciplined strategy, strong governance, and a business model that continues to grow sustainably. The Company’s performance, albeit impacted by severe adverse weather in this quarter, demonstrates the resilience of our platform and the strength of our long-term vision.”
