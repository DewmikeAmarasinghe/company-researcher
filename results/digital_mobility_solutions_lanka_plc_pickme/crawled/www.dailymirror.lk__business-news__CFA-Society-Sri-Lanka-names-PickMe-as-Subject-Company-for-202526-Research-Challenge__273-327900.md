**Jiffry Zulfer**  
  
  
CFA Society Sri Lanka announced that Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC, owner of the PickMe brand, has been selected as the subject company for the 19th annual CFA Institute Research Challenge Sri Lanka competition for the year 2025–2026, with the local finals scheduled for February 2026.  
  
The CFA Institute Research Challenge is a premier global competition designed to nurture the principles of excellence, ethical integrity, and professionalism in equity research among university students. It offers participants hands-on mentoring and rigorous training, enabling them to gain real-world experience in financial analysis and valuation.  
  
Each year, distinguished investment professionals guide student teams as they conduct comprehensive research and develop investment recommendations on a publicly listed company. Last year’s global participation exceeded 7,000 students from more than 1,100 universities across nearly 100 countries, with winning university teams advancing through sub-regional, regional, and global stages under the governance of CFA Institute.  
  
Jiffry Zulfer, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC, expressing his thoughts on PickMe’s role in this global initiative said, “We are honored to be the subject company for this year’s CFA Institute Research Challenge Sri Lanka. PickMe’s evolution from a homegrown startup to a publicly listed technology company reflects the innovation, resilience, and problem-solving mindset that continue to shape Sri Lanka’s digital economy. Supporting this rigorous academic initiative aligns with our commitment to strengthening the country’s talent pipeline and promoting high standards in analytical thinking and ethical conduct. We wish all participating teams every success as they take on this challenge.”  
  
Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC has emerged as one of Sri Lanka’s leading technology companies, launching the country’s first app-based ride-hailing platform in 2015 and evolving into a multi-vertical digital ecosystem spanning mobility, food and marketplace delivery, logistics, trucking, and curated experiences.   
  
In 2024, PickMe marked a major milestone as one of the first homegrown technology companies to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Powered by proprietary AI-driven operations and a shared-economy model that enables thousands of micro-entrepreneurs, PickMe continues to expand its nationwide impact, driving innovation and inclusive digital growth across Sri Lanka.  
  
The response to this year’s competition has been remarkable, with 27 teams from leading state and non-state universities in Sri Lanka selected to participate.   
  
Each team will submit an equity research report and present a final recommendation based on an in-depth analysis of Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC. Shortlisted teams will present and defend their findings before a distinguished panel at the local finals in February 2026. The winning team will advance to represent Sri Lanka in the sub-regional round of the global competition.
