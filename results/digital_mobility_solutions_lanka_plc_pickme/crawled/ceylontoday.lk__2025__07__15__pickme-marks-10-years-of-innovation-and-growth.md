Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed. 
For instance, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,331 billion in February 2022, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,051 billion in that month, the former being more by Rs 280 billion over the latter. And in the previous month January 2022, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,236 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,017 billion that month, the former being more by Rs 219 billion over the latter.
Meanwhile, in December 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,467.9 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 6,981.4 billion, the former being more by Rs 486.5 billion over the latter. In November 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,259 billion and credit to the private sector Rs 6,920.1 billion, an increase of Rs 338.9 billion. 
Similarly, in the months of October, September and August 2021 these respective figures were Rs 7,116.8 billion and Rs 6,859.6 billion, Rs 6,915.2 billion and Rs 6,824.6 billion and Rs 6,819 billion and Rs 6,795.5 billion, increases of Rs 257.2 billion, Rs 90.6 billion and Rs 23.5 billion, respectively. Previously, such a phenomenon occurred for 10 consecutive months, from January 1989 to October 1989, CBSL data showed. 
Three matters of political interest, coinciding with those developments took place during that earlier period. They were President Ranasinghe Premadasa being elected to power at the Presidential Poll of 19 December 1988 and taking over from President J.R. Jayewardene who went into retirement on 31 December 1988, the IPKF fighting the LTTE in the North and East of the country and the JVP fighting the GoSL in the rest of the country. 
However, coinciding with the killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by the Army on 13 November 1989, private sector credit once more overtook credit to both the GoSL and public corporations together beginning from that month, before its collapse nearly 32 years later in August 2021 and continuing to play second fiddle to the GoSL and public corporations till February 2022, according to latest CBSL data.

Digital Mobility Solutions Lanka PLC, owner of PickMe, Sri Lanka’s pioneering digital mobility and lifestyle platform, is celebrating a major milestone: Ten years of using advanced technology to transform how the country moves, connects, and does business.
Launched in 2015 as a homegrown ride-hailing app, PickMe has grown into one of the most-digitally engaged technology companies in Sri Lanka. Today, it is deeply embedded in the country’s social and economic landscape and strategically positioned for international growth.
To mark this milestone, PickMe is placing the spotlight on its users who make it all possible. A nationwide campaign has been launched, featuring a grand raffle draw open to both registered users and independent third-party drivers on the platform. With valuable prizes up to Rs 10 million, the PickMe 10 Year Bonanza is the company’s way of thanking the millions who have supported its journey. It also reaffirms the company’s long-standing commitment to innovation, inclusive growth, and community reward.
**A decade of digital disruption**
PickMe began with a simple but powerful mission: to solve Sri Lanka’s urban mobility inefficiencies using advanced digital tools. At a time when tuk-tuks and taxis lacked coordination and consistency, PickMe developed a real‑time software platform featuring GPS tracking, dynamic pricing, and digital payments to bring order, transparency, and convenience to everyday travel.
That was just the beginning. The platform evolved rapidly, expanding into facilitating logistics and food delivery by 2018. It introduced new functionalities like PickMe Flash and Marketplace in 2021, followed by the subscription-based mobility plan PickMe Pass in 2022.
In 2024, just nine years after its founding, PickMe achieved another landmark by going public on the Colombo Stock Exchange, becoming the first major homegrown tech company to do so. Its IPO was oversubscribed 2.7 times on day one. Beyond the financial milestone, PickMe stands as a testament to Sri Lanka’s ability to birth tech champions powerful enough to go public.
**Powering a shared economy**
PickMe’s model is grounded in shared economy principles — digital-first, decentralised, asset-light, real-time, and inclusive. It’s a platform that empowers micro-entrepreneurs across the island, from tuk-tuk drivers in Jaffna to home cooks in Galle and delivery riders in Kandy.
“Our journey has never been just about building a company, it’s been about building a movement,” said Jiffry Zulfer, Founder and CEO of PickMe. “PickMe is a story of technology-first inclusion, local empowerment, and innovation-led growth. This anniversary belongs to every Sri Lankan who has chosen to trust the platform to connect with us, partner with us, or build the future of our digital ecosystem alongside us.”
Over the past 10 years, PickMe’s impact has been both substantial and far-reaching. The platform has facilitated over 257 million completed movements, served 6.8 million+ users, engaged more than 313,000 registered independent third-party drivers, and travelled over 1.3 billion kilometres, generating over Rs 140 billion+ in total transactions.
Following its IPO, the company posted Rs 1.17 billion+ in profit after tax in the first year alone. These funds are being reinvested into further strengthening the platform’s digital and physical infrastructure, with a special focus on reaching underserved and rural communities.
**Giving back**
In celebration of this decade-long journey, PickMe has launched a 10th year raffle draw, open to both users and independent third-party drivers. Awarded weekly, the rewards include cash prizes worth Rs 4 million to 40 drivers. A total of 208 users will be rewarded with smartphones, smartwatches, PickMe vouchers, movie vouchers, and mobile data bundles, with a grand prize of Rs. 1 million for one lucky winner.
The 10th anniversary grand draw will be promoted in-app, on radio, and across digital platforms with winners announced weekly.
As Sri Lanka charts its path towards digital transformation and economic recovery, PickMe is gearing up for its next chapter. Plans are underway to expand enterprise services, enhance AI-powered mobility systems, and grow its regional presence.
With a bold vision to become South Asia’s leading digitally integrated mobility and lifestyle platform, PickMe is ready to make its next decade even more impactful than the first.
