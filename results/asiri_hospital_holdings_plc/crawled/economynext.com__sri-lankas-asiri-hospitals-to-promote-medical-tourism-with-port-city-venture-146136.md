ECONOMYNEXT – Asiri Port City Hospital (Pvt) Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC’s, proposes to develop a state-of-the-art hospital within the Colombo Port City with an investment of 100 million dollars.
“This new venture… is a significant milestone in the country’s journey towards developing and attracting medical tourism to Sri Lanka,” Ashok Pathirage, Chairman/Managing Director of Asiri Hospital Holdings Plc, said in a statement on the CSE.
“The combination of expertise and international collaboration with which Asiri Port City Hospital (Pvt) Ltd will enter the local market is envisaged to revamp the country’s healthcare sector to newer heights, and of becoming Asia’s medical tourism destination.”
The Company received Cabinet approval this week to be designated as a Primary Business of Strategic Importance, which means it would be granted several exemptions or incentives under 2(b) of the Colombo Port City (Guidelines on the Grant of Exemptions or Incentives to Businesses of Strategic Importance) Regulations, No 2 of 2023.
Asiri Port City Hospital, part of the Softlogic Group of Companies, will design, develop, and operate the hospital “partnered with a corporation globally renowned for its innovative treatment options, who will provide strategic and/or operational consulting services to Asiri Port City Hospital,” Pathirage was quoted in the statement.
The corporation was not named.
The Port City Hospital will be designed “to deliver innovative and state-of-the-art health care solutions and unique patient care services drawing from the expertise of Asiri Hospitals in promoting health through integrated clinical practice, education and research.” 
It will also “be designed to transform medicine to connect and cure as the global authority in the care of serious or complex diseases.” 
Its medical team will have both local and international medical experts and specialists, who will be supported by internationally trained and experienced nursing and medical care staff, Pathirage said.
Sri Lanka’s health sector has suffered several setbacks with a shortage of medicines and a lack of staff including doctors and nurses in the state-owned main hospitals as well as the regional hospitals.
Medical staff have left the country to work in foreign countries, citing the higher taxes imposed by the government as necessitated by an IMF bailout program.
Public confidence in the nation’s health sector has eroded considerably after several deaths were reported. 
The Colombo Port City is a multiple currency special economic zone. (Colombo/Jan5/2024)

Friday January 30, 2026 11:53 am
ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure has signed an agreement with regional plantation companies (RPCs) to increase estate workers’ wages to 1,750 a day, a statement said.
A 2026 Budget proposal was to increase by 400 rupees the current 1,350 rupee daily wage of an estate worker, with the government paying 200 of this. 
This would bring the total daily wage of an estate worker to 1,750 rupees.
The revised wage is be effective from 1 January 2026. 
Opposition members opposed the move as they pointed out that the government would be using public funds to pay private sector wages.
Sri Lanka RPCs are privately managed entities involved in cultivation, production, and processing of tea, rubber, coconut, and cinnamon across estates. 
These include Hayleys Plantations (Kelani Valley, Talawakelle, Horana), Browns Plantations (Maturata, Udapussellawa, Hapugastenne), and Elpitiya Plantations. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)

# Sri Lanka’s private sector credit slows in December: CB official

Friday January 30, 2026 11:00 am
ECONOMYNEXT – Credit to Sri Lanka’s private sector slowed in December after being steady at around 200 billion rupees monthly, a top Central Bank official said, amid an expected slowdown in economic activities after Cyclone Ditwah disaster.
The private credit volumes from commercial banks have slowed to 183 billion rupees in December 2025 from a new high of 262 billion rupees in the previous month.
The 12-month growth in the private sector credit growth also has fallen to 25.2 percent last month, compared to 26 percent in November 2025, official data showed.
“We have seen notable expansion from June onwards by over 200 billion rupees a month, but some slow down observed in December as shown by provisional data to 183 billion,” S. Jegajeevan, Director of the Central Bank’s Economic Research Department told reporters on Wednesday (28).
She did not explain the reason for the slow down, but analysts attribute the slowdown to lower economic activities in December after the disaster late in November.
Jegajeevan said improving demand conditions as well as notable increase in vehicle imports led to strong private credit demand in the second half of 2025 with a slowdown in December. (Colombo/January 30/2026)

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Central Bank will continue its dollar purchasing from the market in January after acquiring the US currency for the past few months straight, Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

It has bought a net 2 billion US dollars in the last 12 months, official data showed.
“You can see our interventions in the market. Even if you look at the month of December, we have been intervening and purchasing a large amount of foreign exchange to build reserves up to this level,” he told reporters on Wednesday (28) after the Central Bank announced its policy rates, which were left unchanged.
“You can see that is continuing this month as well.”
The Central Bank’s dollar purchasing helped it boost foreign currency reserves to 6.8 billion dollars by end 2025. (Colombo/Jan30/2026)
