##  Asiri Central Hospital Receives Bronze Award at Presidential Environment Awards 2024 
Previous Next
﻿Asiri Central Hospital (ACH) is very honored to be the recipient of the Bronze Award of Commendation at the Presidential Environment Awards 2024, in the category for hospitals. This recognition is especially meaningful because ACH is the only private to be awarded out of a total of 60 entrants in the category.
This achievement is a proud testament to the commitment made by the Asiri Group toward supporting the environment and promoting sustainability in its everyday business. Over the past 3 years Asiri Central Hospital has implemented significant initiatives and practices which include efforts to reduce carbon emissions, conserve energy and water, manage waste effectively, promote recycling, and adopt environmentally friendly practices in healthcare services.
This is only the start for the Asiri Health Group who have several more plans in place in support of its ESG goals.
