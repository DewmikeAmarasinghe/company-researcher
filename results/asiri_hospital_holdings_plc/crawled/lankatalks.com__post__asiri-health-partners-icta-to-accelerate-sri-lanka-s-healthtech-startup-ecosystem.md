  *   *   * 

Asiri Health partners with the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) to support and accelerate the growth of HealthTech startups, marking a significant step in strengthening Sri Lanka’s innovation-led healthcare ecosystem. This strategic collaboration was unveiled during ‘Global Entrepreneurship Week 2025’, at a HealthTech startup pitching session organized by ICTA. At the event, seven HealthTech startups presented innovative solutions addressing critical healthcare and technology challenges. Asiri Health participated as the healthcare partner, offering startups direct exposure to the senior leadership team at Asiri Health, real hospital environments, expert clinical feedback and commercial insights. The program is designed to help startups refine their solutions, validate them in live healthcare settings and prepare for scalable growth locally and internationally.
Asiri Health’s involvement reflects its positioning as an innovation-driven healthcare leader that actively partners with startups to improve patient experience, clinical efficiency and healthcare delivery. The Group aims to adopt, pilot and partner with promising HealthTech solutions that align with its focus on quality, accessibility and technology-enabled care.
ICTA’s role centers on building and enabling Sri Lanka’s national digital and HealthTech ecosystem by connecting innovators with industry leaders, strengthening startup pipelines.
Speaking at the event, Sachindra Samarathna, Associate Chief Digital Economy Officer at ICTA, said, “This initiative creates meaningful pathways for HealthTech startups to engage with industry leaders and healthcare professionals. We are grateful to Asiri Health for opening their ecosystem to innovators and providing valuable feedback and exposure. This collaboration reflects our commitment to building a strong digital and HealthTech sector that contributes to the government’s ambition of a USD 5 billion digital economy by 2030.”
Imran Furkan, Board Director of Asiri Health, highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership, “Asiri Health continuously looks for innovations that can enhance patient experience and healthcare delivery. Partnering with ICTA allows us to engage with some of the most promising HealthTech innovators in the country. The interaction between startups, medical professionals and corporate leaders has been extremely valuable, and we see strong potential to pilot, partner and scale these solutions within our hospital network and beyond.”
The pitching session enabled startups to engage directly with senior healthcare specialists, hospital leadership and technology experts, gaining insights into clinical needs, operational realities, and governance expectations within the healthcare sector. This feedback-driven approach is expected to strengthen solution-market fit and improve startup scalability.
Looking ahead, Asiri Health and ICTA intend to establish the HealthTech startup showcase as an annual initiative, creating a structured platform to identify, nurture and scale HealthTech innovation. The long-term vision is to support startups in piloting solutions locally and in preparing for regional and international expansion.
