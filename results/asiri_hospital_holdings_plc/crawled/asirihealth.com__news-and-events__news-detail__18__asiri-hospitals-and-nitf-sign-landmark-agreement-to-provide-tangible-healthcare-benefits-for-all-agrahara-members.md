The enduring partnership aims to offer tangible healthcare benefits and the renowned comprehensive healthcare services offered by Asiri Hospitals to all NITF Agrahara members. It marks a major milestone in Asiri Hospitals' commitment to build long-term collaborations that benefits the community. It also reaffirms Asiri Hospitals' position as a trusted healthcare provider ensuring healthcare is more accessible, affordable, while uplifting the living standards of the public service.
Importantly, Agrahara members are eligible to seek treatment from any hospital in the Asiri group or its laboratories. The agreement also introduces a cashless admission scheme for NITF members, simplifying the process and enabling seamless access to Asiri Hospitals' services without the need for upfront payments. Members can benefit from waived admission fees, reducing the financial burden for those seeking medical care. Room rates are also heavily discounted.
The MoU entitles Agrahara members to a variety of exclusive discounts on outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) services at Asiri Hospitals. Additionally, discounts on laboratory investigations, on interventional radiology, PET scans, and radiation therapy.
