90%+
Of tickets were successfully resolved.
## **Introduction**
Efficient facility maintenance is critical to ensuring seamless patient care in any hospital. This case study explores how Asiri Hospitals, one of Sri Lanka’s leading private healthcare providers, enhanced its maintenance operations by adopting Emojot’s AI-powered Facilities Management System (FMS).
Implemented across seven hospitals, Emojot’s FMS helped automate and streamline the management of HVAC systems, electrical infrastructure, plumbing, and critical medical equipment. Since launching in August 2020, the system has processed over 29,000 maintenance tickets, achieving an impressive 93.8% resolution rate by 2023—a testament to its impact on operational excellence.
## **About Emojot’s FMS**
Emojot’s Facilities Management System is a robust digital platform tailored to automate and optimize maintenance workflows within complex environments like hospitals.
Key features include:
  * Digital ticketing system for instant issue reporting
  * Automated issue classification (e.g., HVAC, electrical, plumbing, medical equipment)
  * Real-time alerts and escalations via SMS and email
  * Performance dashboards offering analytics for data-driven decision-making


This system ensures rapid response, task accountability, and complete visibility into facility operations.
## **The Challenge**
Prior to adopting Emojot’s FMS, Asiri Hospitals relied on manual, paper-based maintenance processes. This led to:
  * Delayed response times
  * Poor visibility into issue resolution
  * Human errors and communication gaps
  * Difficulty managing diverse maintenance requests, from painting to medical gas systems


As the hospital network expanded, scaling these inefficient processes became increasingly challenging.
## **The Solution**
Emojot deployed a centralized digital maintenance platform that transformed how Asiri handled maintenance requests.
  * Staff could submit tickets via desktop or mobile
  * Each ticket was automatically categorized and routed to the correct team
  * Intelligent task assignment based on issue type (e.g., plumbing vs. biomedical)
  * Supervisors received real-time updates and status tracking


This smart automation dramatically improved speed, efficiency, and coordination across departments.
## **How the System Works**
How the System Works
Here’s a simplified view of the process:
  * Issue Reported → via mobile or desktop
  * Auto-Routing → system assigns the task to the appropriate team
  * Task Execution → team resolves the issue
  * Real-Time Updates → managers and admins are kept in the loop
  * Closure & Documentation → issues are resolved, tracked, and archived


This structured workflow guarantees complete traceability, accountability, and quick turnaround.
## **Dashboard and Analytics**
Emojot’s Operations Intelligence Dashboard empowered Asiri’s admin teams with real-time insights, including:
  * Number of open/closed tickets
  * Response and resolution times
  * Patterns in recurring issues


By leveraging this data, Asiri was able to:
  * Optimize resource allocation
  * Identify process bottlenecks
  * Prioritize critical maintenance tasks


## **Benefits Achieved**
After implementing Emojot’s FMS, Asiri Hospitals experienced:
  * Faster issue resolution with automation
  * 93.8% resolution rate by 2023
  * Improved team productivity through intelligent task routing
  * Reduced operational costs due to fewer errors and faster workflows
  * Improved patient safety with timely resolution of facility issues


## **System Transformation**
This digital transformation enabled staff to immediately report faults – especially in high-risk areas like medical equipment, electrical systems, and HVAC – triggering real-time alerts and faster action.
The automated assignment process eliminated delays and allowed maintenance operations to run proactively rather than reactively.
## **Strategic Implementation**
The FMS was rolled out in phases:
  * Process audit and gap analysis
  * Pilot deployment and feedback loop
  * System customization and scaling
  * Ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement


This approach ensured smooth adoption while minimizing disruption.
## **Emojot’s Support Services**
Emojot provided full post-deployment support, including:
  * On-site and virtual training for hospital teams
  * Customization to align with internal workflows
  * Access to real-world use cases and continuous consulting


This hands-on approach empowered hospital staff to fully utilize the system and drive real results.
## **Return on Investment (ROI)**
Through Emojot’s FMS, Asiri Hospitals gained a strong ROI by:
  * Minimizing facility downtime
  * Boosting efficiency in maintenance resolution
  * Ensuring infrastructure readiness for patient care
  * Reducing labor costs via automation
  * Scaling operations with no compromise on service quality


## **Conclusion**
By embracing Emojot’s Facilities Management System, Asiri Hospitals revolutionised its approach to facility maintenance.
Since 2020, the platform has processed over 29,000 tickets, achieving a 93.8% resolution rate and establishing a new gold standard in healthcare operations.
Asiri’s success story illustrates the power of digital transformation in hospital maintenance, proving that smarter systems lead to safer, more efficient care.
