Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed. 
For instance, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,331 billion in February 2022, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,051 billion in that month, the former being more by Rs 280 billion over the latter. And in the previous month January 2022, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,236 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,017 billion that month, the former being more by Rs 219 billion over the latter.
Meanwhile, in December 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,467.9 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 6,981.4 billion, the former being more by Rs 486.5 billion over the latter. In November 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,259 billion and credit to the private sector Rs 6,920.1 billion, an increase of Rs 338.9 billion. 
Similarly, in the months of October, September and August 2021 these respective figures were Rs 7,116.8 billion and Rs 6,859.6 billion, Rs 6,915.2 billion and Rs 6,824.6 billion and Rs 6,819 billion and Rs 6,795.5 billion, increases of Rs 257.2 billion, Rs 90.6 billion and Rs 23.5 billion, respectively. Previously, such a phenomenon occurred for 10 consecutive months, from January 1989 to October 1989, CBSL data showed. 
Three matters of political interest, coinciding with those developments took place during that earlier period. They were President Ranasinghe Premadasa being elected to power at the Presidential Poll of 19 December 1988 and taking over from President J.R. Jayewardene who went into retirement on 31 December 1988, the IPKF fighting the LTTE in the North and East of the country and the JVP fighting the GoSL in the rest of the country. 
However, coinciding with the killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by the Army on 13 November 1989, private sector credit once more overtook credit to both the GoSL and public corporations together beginning from that month, before its collapse nearly 32 years later in August 2021 and continuing to play second fiddle to the GoSL and public corporations till February 2022, according to latest CBSL data.

Asiri Health has partnered with the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) to accelerate the growth of the country’s HealthTech startup ecosystem, marking a significant step towards strengthening innovation-led healthcare in Sri Lanka.
The strategic collaboration was unveiled during Global Entrepreneurship Week 2025 at a HealthTech startup pitching session organised by ICTA. Seven HealthTech startups presented innovative solutions aimed at addressing critical healthcare and technology challenges.
As the healthcare partner, Asiri Health provided startups with direct access to its senior leadership team, real hospital environments, expert clinical feedback and commercial insights. The initiative is designed to help startups refine their solutions, validate them in live healthcare settings, and prepare for scalable growth both locally and internationally.
Asiri Health’s participation reflects its positioning as an innovation-driven healthcare leader that actively collaborates with startups to enhance patient experience, clinical efficiency and overall healthcare delivery. The Group intends to adopt, pilot and partner with promising HealthTech solutions aligned with its focus on quality, accessibility and technology-enabled care.
ICTA’s role focuses on building and enabling Sri Lanka’s national digital and HealthTech ecosystem by connecting innovators with industry leaders and strengthening the startup pipeline.
Speaking at the event, Sachindra Samarathna, Associate Chief Digital Economy Officer at ICTA, said the initiative creates meaningful pathways for HealthTech startups to engage with industry leaders and healthcare professionals. He noted that the collaboration aligns with ICTA’s commitment to building a strong digital and HealthTech sector that supports the government’s ambition of achieving a USD 5 billion digital economy by 2030.
Imran Furkan, Board Director of Asiri Health, highlighted the strategic value of the partnership, stating that Asiri Health continuously seeks innovations that enhance patient experience and healthcare delivery. He added that collaborating with ICTA enables engagement with some of the most promising HealthTech innovators in the country, with strong potential to pilot, partner and scale solutions across Asiri Health’s hospital network and beyond.
The pitching session enabled startups to engage directly with senior healthcare specialists, hospital leadership and technology experts, gaining insights into clinical needs, operational realities and governance expectations within the healthcare sector. This feedback-driven approach is expected to strengthen solution–market fit and improve startup scalability.
Looking ahead, Asiri Health and ICTA plan to establish the HealthTech startup showcase as an annual initiative, creating a structured platform to identify, nurture and scale HealthTech innovation, while supporting startups in piloting solutions locally and preparing for regional and international expansion.
