Asiri Central Hospital, the flagship hospital among the Asiri Group of Hospitals, received the Joint Commission International (JCI) Accreditation for the second time recently.  
This is a quality standard granted to hospitals globally, indicating the excellent quality and safety of the medical care administered at hospitals. With rigid measurement elements, JCI standards are patient-centric, particularly in safety, healthcare quality and quality management systems, overall endorsing the Gold Seal of Approval®. The JCI accreditation renewal process is conducted every three years, Asiri said in a media release.  
Asiri Central Hospital passed the re-accreditation inspection achieving over 90 per cent compliance rate subsequent to a formal accreditation inspection conducted by a visiting JCI delegation, which was concluded early this year.   
The JCI inspection team including a nursing professional, physician and facilities professional, each with decades of experience in health systems around the world, conducted the comprehensive surveys reviewing all clinical and operational processes. The high compliance rate demonstrates Asiri Central Hospital’s dedication towards continuously maintaining high levels of patient safety standards and care.  
Commenting on receiving the renewal, Dr. Manjula Karunaratne CEO, said “This is a landmark achievement for Asiri Central Hospital and we are extremely pleased to receive such a high validation for our efforts. We take pride that the success of our hospital is based on the fundamentals of quality and patient safety as it affirms our commitment to implement professional and measurable standards that bring continuous improvement into the daily routine. The results of the inspection constitute an additional layer where the hospital meets stricter, specific and measurable requirements, setting the bar even higher.”
