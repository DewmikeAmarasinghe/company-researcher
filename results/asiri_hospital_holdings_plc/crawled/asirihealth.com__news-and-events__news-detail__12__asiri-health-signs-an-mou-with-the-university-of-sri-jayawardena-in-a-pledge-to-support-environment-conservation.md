##  Asiri Health Signs an MoU with the University of Sri Jayawardena in a Pledge to Support Environment Conservation 
Previous Next
Asiri Health has pledged to support biodiversity by creating habitats in an area equivalent to the space it operates in. This commitment reflects the organization's dedication to environmental conservation and sustainability.
  

In 2022, Asiri Health took a significant step towards fulfilling its pledge for biodiversity conservation by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Center for Sustainability, Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, University of Sri Jayewardenepura. This collaboration marked the beginning of a concerted effort to restore degraded forest land within the Yagirala Forest Reserve, demonstrating our commitment to environmental stewardship.
  

The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) took place on 3rd February 2022 at the Vice-Chancellor's office of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The ceremony was attended by Group CEO Dr. Manjula Karunaratne and Vice-Chancellor Senior Professor Sudantha Liyanage, who signed the MOU, formalizing the collaborative agreement. The project's design reflects a holistic approach to forest management, emphasizing the restoration of native flora and mitigating the impact of invasive species. By restoring degraded areas and promoting native plant diversity, the program contributes to habitat restoration, soil conservation, and water resource protection within the forest reserve.
