##### Sleep Study 
Are you concerned about your sleep? 
Are you sleeping enough? 
Is your sleep structure good? 
Do you have any sleep related disorder that is hindering you from achieving your best? 
If you have loud snoring, fall asleep during the day or feel tired all the time and feel sleepy despite having had around 8 hours of sleep the previous night; you may be suffering from a sleep disorder! 
During normal sleep, muscles that control the tongue and soft palate keep the airway open. If these muscles relax, the airway contracts and this may cause snoring and breathing difficulties. If your breathing is obstructed during sleep completely or partially, for five or more instances in an hour, it indicates that you have Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) which is quite a significant and common sleep disorder. Such disorders often go undiagnosed but the consequences of not receiving early treatment can be serious. 
_It is linked to problems such as,_
  * High blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)
  * High blood pressure
  * Depression
  * Stroke
  * Heart failure
  * Coronary artery disease
  * Hormone imbalance
  * Irregular heart rhythms


_Symptoms of OSA_
  * Excessive snoring 
  * Pauses in breathing during sleep 
  * Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue
  * Falling asleep easily during the day 
  * Fragmented sleep
  * Morning headaches 
  * Excessive movement while sleeping


_What should you do if you have these symptoms?_
  * **Screening:** Answer a simple set of questions (questionnaire linked below) and give it to your doctor, who will assess your level of risk. This questionnaire is also available at the Reception Desk of any Asiri Group Hospital. Pls advise on how best to include the questionnaire, which I will be sharing along with this document.
  * **Diagnosis:** Depending on your level of risk, your doctor may recommend a sleep test which can be performed at Asiri Central Hospital. We have the latest sleep lab with facilities for Level I and II polysomnogram.
  * **Treatment:** After assessing your sleep test results your doctor will explain your sleep structure to you - how much time you spend in deep sleep, what problems are detected in each stage of sleep, whether you have sleep apnoea, type and severity, any other sleep disorder. Depending on the diagnoses, he may then recommend treatment which usually involves using a facemask and a CPAP therapy device (CPAP stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure and is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep the airways open) during the night.


## What sets us apart?
  * We are the only private-sector healthcare provider in Sri Lanka to run a Sleep Study Unit with specialist medical professionals who are trained in this field.
  * The sleep laboratory is equipped with the latest cutting-edge technology and manned by medical personnel who are skilled at using such state-of-the art equipment.
  * The Sleep Studies Unit is specially designed to put you at ease and help you fall asleep while a specialist monitors your breathing patterns.


## Our services 
  * Sleep Level 1 with video recording 
  * EEG - A test that detects abnormalities in your brain waves, or in the electrical activity of your brain.
  * EOG - This is an electrophysiologic test that measures the existing resting electrical potential between the cornea and Bruch's membrane in the eye, which is important to identify each sleep stage.
  * EMG - Electromyography is a diagnostic procedure to assess the work of muscles and the nerve cells that control them.
  * ECG, nasal pressure transducers - Heart, Breathing Muscle Effort, Air Flow and Pulse Rate.

All of these procedures can usually be administered as ‘day procedures’, meaning a patient won’t have to stay in hospital overnight.
