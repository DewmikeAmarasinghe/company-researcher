##  Inspiring Stories! 
Read heartfelt testimonials from patients who experienced exceptional care at Asiri Medical Hospital. 
I've no words to express my gratitude for the Asiri BMT team who cared for me more than anyone has in this world. I was in a lot of pain, their patience and caring encouragement gave me hope and strengthened me through the 45-day transplant process.
**Ms. Charuni Apsara**
මම ආසිරි හාට් සෙන්ටර් එකට එනකොට මගේ ජීවිතය 90% ක් වගේ අවදානමේ තිබුණා. ආසිරි හාට් සෙන්ටර් එකේ වෛද්යවරුන්ගේ ඉක්මන් ප්‍රතිචාර සහ නිවැරදි ක්‍රියාමාර්ග නිසා මගේ ජීවිතය බේරුණා. 
**රමාල් ජාසිංහ මහතා**
I really didn't think I had it in me to battle Cancer. But it changed the moment I walked into Asiri AOI Cancer Care Centre. 
**Cancer Survivor**
ජීවිතය ගැන වෛද්යවරුන් පවා අවිශ්වාස තැබූ මොහොතක, මාගේ සැමියාගේ ජීවිතයේ වගකීම භාරගෙන මාගේ සැමියාට ජීවිතය දුන් ආසිරි සෙන්ට්රල් රෝහලේ ස්නායු ඒකකයේ වෛද්යවරුන්ට සහ කාර්යමණ්ඩලයට මාගේ ගෞරවණිය ස්තුතිය පුද කරනවා.
