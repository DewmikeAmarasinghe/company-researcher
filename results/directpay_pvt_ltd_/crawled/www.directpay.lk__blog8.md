We are still overjoyed by winning 3 awards at the National ICT Awards (NBQSA) 2020 and being selected to represent Sri Lanka at APICTA in Malaysia. 
  

1. Silver Award for DirectPay Smart POS  
2. Bronze Award for Internet Payment Gateway (IPG)  
3. Merit Award for DirectPay Virtual POS  

  

The APICTA Awards is the largest IT competition in the Asia Pacific Region organized in order to bring awareness on ICT among the community and assist in bridging the digital divide. In 2018, DirectPay represented Sri Lanka at APICTA in China and won a gold award in the Consumer - Wealth and Retail Category by competing with 14 other countries in the Asia Pacific region. 
  

A massive shout out to our team for their dedication and hard work that was put into gaining this achievement.
