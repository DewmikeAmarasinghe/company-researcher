The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced a partnership with DirectPay, one of the fastest-growing fintech start-ups in Sri Lanka, to provide Internet Payment Gateway (IPG) support and operate as the acquiring bank for the cashless payment solutions the latter develops for clients, a news release from ComBank said.
“With this partnership with Commercial Bank, DirectPay aims to expand its suite of services such as fully-integrated payment Point-of-Sale devices to discover new markets and inventory management solutions with payment integration on Card and LankaQR payments for Small and Medium (SME) businesses and corporates in the country. DirectPay will also collaborate with the Bank on products such as micro lending and pay-day loans, as well as to offer its merchant clientele more efficient ways of making supply chain payments,” it said.
Further, with the backing of Commercial Bank and its expertise as a leading IPG service provider in the country, DirectPay will enhance its offerings of customised digital payment solutions for businesses in the insurance, education, and eCommerce industries that will enable them to move away from cash-on-delivery-based transactions and facilitate a host of digital payment options for the products and services offered. The introduction of these modern payment methods is aimed at providing customers with a choice of multiple payment options, the Company said.
A specialised service provider to businesses operating in the financial and telecom industries, DirectPay which was founded in 2018 and has developed multiple payment channels that benefit both the end customer and the client’s suppliers. These solutions include mobile-based payment apps, internet payment gateways, payment links to receive remote payments, and subscription payments where there is recurring revenue or bill settlement,” the release explained.
“A preferred IPG partner to a cross section of businesses in Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank provides payment processing services via Mastercard Payment Gateway Services (MPGS) and Visa Cybersource platforms that offer tokenization support, eliminating the need for customers to re-enter their card details when performing repetitive transactions with a specific merchant. This is made possible as the card details are stored securely by the Bank which generates a unique token, keeping the purchasers’ sensitive card details away from the merchants’ systems.”
“Further, these solutions provide access to a comprehensive set of fraud mitigation tools, supporting both ‘Mastercard Secure Code’ and ‘Verified by Visa’ 3D secure authentication solutions while having the fully-automated process to handle ComBank Easy Payment Plans (EPP). Besides offering security, one of the most crucial features of cashless payments, Commercial Bank’s IPG solutions also support device-optimised payment screens which are designed to offer a seamless experience to users of various devices; a feature much requested by the local eCommerce industry.”

Writer Corporation, one of India’s leading business groups, announced the launch of its subsidiary, Writer Business Services Pvt. Ltd., and the commencement of its operations in Sri Lanka. The expansion reflects Sri Lanka’s strategic importance in Writer’s regional growth plans and its role in supporting a highly regulated digital and financial services market which is currently undergoing digital transformation.
Sri Lanka’s continued focus on strengthening regulatory frameworks, digital platforms, and financial systems is shaping how institutions across banking, government, and enterprise sectors approach their business operations. There is a clear emphasis on secure, compliant, and resilient information and transaction environments that can scale with regulatory and business needs. Writer’s entry into Sri Lanka aligns with this direction, bringing global experience and a partnership-led approach to the market.
As part of its launch, Writer will establish a secure records and information storage facility in Seeduwa, Colombo. Designed to meet global standards for security, compliance, and disaster resilience, the facility will support banks, financial institutions, government bodies, and large enterprises in managing physical and digital information across its lifecycle.
Alongside information management, Writer brings established expertise in integrated payment services to support the modernization of transaction infrastructure across the banking and financial services sector. Its payments capabilities focus on strengthening availability, transaction continuity, and transparency across critical payment channels that underpin institutional reliability and customer confidence.
Writer’s digital payments offerings in Sri Lanka include end-to-end ATM and self-service terminal outsourcing, integrated channel ownership and managed services, field management applications, payment and reconciliation platforms, and remote monitoring with near real-time reporting. These solutions support financial institutions in improving uptime, strengthening governance, and enhancing operational efficiency across payment networks, in line with the continued evolution of electronic and automated payment systems.
Across information management and payments, Writer operates with an integrated portfolio spanning records and information management, business process outsourcing, cloud and digital services, data privacy, cybersecurity and enterprise payments infrastructure. These capabilities support institutions in addressing evolving regulatory requirements, digitization of legacy environments, and rising operational and cyber risks.
Writer’s local presence enables closer collaboration with clients and on-ground delivery, while supporting the development of Centres of Excellence across cybersecurity operations, SOC and NOC services, AI-led solutions, and payments operations and monitoring.
Writer’s Sri Lanka operations will be built, led, and run by Sri Lankan professionals, reflecting a long-term commitment to local talent growth and development.
Commenting on this development, Satyamohan Yanambaka, CEO, Writer Global Services Pvt. Ltd., assured Writer’s long-term commitment to the country’s digital ambitions. He said, “Writer’s entry into Sri Lanka reflects our belief that digital ambition in regulated environments must be supported by trust, sound governance, and strong execution. As institutions scale digital services, the reliability of information and payment systems, channel operations, and governance frameworks becomes increasingly important to public and institutional confidence. Our experience across information management, digital transformation, and enterprise payments enables us to support secure, large-scale financial ecosystems, with a clear commitment to building and leading these capabilities locally.”
Sri Lanka’s Digital Personal Data Protection framework raises expectations around how personal and sensitive information is secured and governed.
