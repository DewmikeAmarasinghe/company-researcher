#### Management Discussion and Analysis
# Leading Through Innovation
Conventional business models and ecosystems are being rapidly transformed, and the rate of technological change and the rush of new, agile, entrants to the financial landscape has intensified competition and risk over the past few years. Especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, banking has entered a new chapter in its evolution, with consumers being much more aware of digital banking features and many first-time users have grown accustomed to using them. In the post-pandemic “new normal”, the banking landscape is shifting to “digital by choice,” offering customers instant gratification, increased convenience, flexibility, and tailored services they seek. As a pioneer in the digital space, the Bank welcomes these challenges driving inclusion of all consumer segments into a digital economy. 
Even as the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and forced radical changes in customer behaviour, customers’ demand for digital products and the comfort and willingness to engage digitally has increased, with significant portions of the economy moved online. In such a milieu, the Bank delivered compelling, emotive digital propositions that elevate customer experience to meet the expectations of this new normal. Especially during the June-September 2020 period when the entire country was on lockdown and banking was made one of the essential services in the country, demand for continuity of service through digital channels escalated. The investments made by the Bank over the years in building its digital ecosystem provided a strong foundation to meet these challenges and become a pioneer in the digital payment space, spearheading many initiatives and technological innovations, both for retail customers and corporate customers.
## Digital Road Map 2021 – 2023
Aligned to the Bank’s digital vision of building a digital economy where each customer is engaged at their level of techno-literacy, the Bank’s Digital Road Map is focused on retail customers encompassing products, services, processes and touch points. The digital transformation for the next three years is driven by three goals: 
  * Ensure business growth
  * Create business value
  * Enhance digital customer experience


Accordingly, the Bank will continue to invest in redesigning its conventional banking processes as digital processes, integrating with other ecosystems and upgrading internal systems to be ready to adapt to anticipated changes in the regulatory environment and risk management. Reskilling staff and attracting specialised talent, building partnerships, and developing data capabilities continue to be areas of emphasis.

## Migration to digital channels
The Bank set up Mini Digital Experience Zones to help customers gradually migrate to digital channels. These zones are strategically placed to attract conventional customers giving them the opportunity to experience the Bank’s digital offerings.

These electronic spaces is another industry first by the Bank offering basics of digital services, including facilities for customers to submit loan inquiries and requests for fixed deposits.

In partnership with DirectPay, one of the fastest-growing fintech start-ups in Sri Lanka, the Bank provided Internet Payment Gateway (IPG) support and became the acquiring bank for the cashless payment solutions of DirectPay. In collaboration with UnionPay International (UPI), the Bank issued a unified QR code under LANKAQR specifications that includes the UnionPay QR code, thereby widening the user base for electronic and digital payments, catering even to foreigners visiting Sri Lanka. Opening its door to the new era of E-Commerce that is faster and more convenient, the Bank became the first in Sri Lanka to deploy EMV 3DS fraud prevention technology for authenticating payments made by credit, debit, and pre-paid cards in collaboration with Visa.

With users in more than 100 countries, the log in rate is 20 per second, averaging more than 1,000 active users per minute, and over 1 million customer registrations. The app enables users to self-add, remove, or group Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Credit Cards. Future enhancements to the app will include viewing unlimited transaction history, including unrealized cheques, account holds and the total overdraft limit for current accounts.

PCI-DSS is the global data security standard adopted by payment card brands for all entities that process, store, or transmit cardholder data and sensitive authentication data. It is one of the most stringent technical standards and its maintenance requires significant expertise and resources. This certification also covers the Bangladesh operations of the Bank.
The Bank has installed layered security controls which include Firewalls and other security devices to counter malware attacks in addition to maintaining the controls such as updating OS and application patches, maintaining backups, restrictions on remote access. To secure IT services, security controls such as threat protection for emails and a multi factor authentication in accessing critical systems has been introduced. The Bank provides tokenization support to its merchants enabling them to facilitate frictionless E-Commerce transactions to their customers. The Bank stores the card details within the Bank’s systems and provision tokens in merchant’s websites ensuring maximum protection to cardholders. The Bank also have enabled EMV 3DS functionality for its cardholders as well as E-Commerce merchants ensuring the highest protection available as per EMVCo standards. Mobile device management has been implemented with device control and hard disk encryption to improve the overall security posture of remote teleworking devices.
