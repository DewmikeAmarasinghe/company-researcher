### Why should I create an online profile for my business?
One of the most effective ways to grow your business is by having a strong digital profile. Let’s understand this using a simple example. Lisa is a business owner in the garment manufacturing industry. One fine day she gets an offer from John who operates in the retailing industry and claims to sell products to big brands. Lisa is excited about getting into a business partnership with John, but how can his business be validated? Lisa googles John’s business and doesn’t find much on the internet as there are no product/service listings, not a valid online profile or website. This changes Lisa’s mind and she pulls back from the offer and John loses what otherwise could have been a great business partnership!
While we’re sure you’ve heard that taking the time to make a complete profile is important, perhaps you haven’t really understood why that is. Click here for the top 6 reasons why a completed profile is critical in helping you get the most for your business.
