## About Directpay...
Shape a brighter financial future with us!
DirectPay is a Sri Lankan startup that is solving the problem of getting paid. We believe that payment is always a byproduct of some other transaction and we are addressing how to pursue that payment digitally. It could be either through a mobile-based payment app, an Internet payment gateway, a payment link to receive remote payments, subscription payments where there’s a recurring revenue or it could be a bill settlement. Whichever it is, we ensure a seamless journey to customers or service providers, covering the entire payment ecosystem.
## VISION
To revolutionize Sri Lanka’s payment landscape by seamlessly integrating innovative digital solutions, fostering a cashless society, and enhancing financial inclusion across all demographics. 
## MISSION
To deliver secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital payment experiences by leveraging cutting-edge technology and strategic partnerships, thereby empowering businesses and consumers alike.
