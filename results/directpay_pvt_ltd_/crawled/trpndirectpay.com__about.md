Three Rivers Provider Network (TRPN) was founded in 1996 and remains the largest and fastest growing provider network in the United States built through direct contracts. Currently offering more than 4.3 million participating provider locations and serving over 100 million patients, TRPN is comprised of healthcare providers of all types and specialties in all 50 states from single-physician offices to large-scale health systems.
DirectPay is a claim payment process founded in 2018 that uses proprietary methodologies and analysis to take a global look at claim payments to ensure providers receive full and proper remittances. Through these technologies and established relationships with payers, clearinghouses and other managed care organizations involved in the payment of medical claims, we are able to include monitoring of 837s, 277s, 999s, 835s and many other industry file types as part of our review process.
By partnering TRPN and DirectPay, we’ve given the medical community an opportunity to gain access to extensive industry expertise and a comprehensive view of claim payment across the healthcare ecosystem. Our ability to offer a global, data-driven approach to claims management is unmatched and translates into better outcomes across the board — for providers, patients and payers.
