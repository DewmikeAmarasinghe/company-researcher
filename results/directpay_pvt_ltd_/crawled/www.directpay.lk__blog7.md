_Three prestigious awards won by DirectPay._
DirectPay, a state-of-the-art fintech solution driving financial inclusion through cashless means, was recognized as the island-wide winner of the “Best Disruptor 2021” award and was also awarded the prestigious “Best Disruptor – Western Province” award along with “Best Innovation in Business Management” at the SLASSCOM National Ingenuity Awards 2021 held recently at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.
  

The Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM), the national chamber for the IT and BPM industry in Sri Lanka held the SLASSCOM Ingenuity Awards 2021 for the third consecutive year, in celebration of great innovators in Sri Lanka. The award ceremony recognizes and rewards innovations that fuel ingenuity by conducting an all-island competition representing all-age groups, all ethnic groups, businesses of all sizes, universities and schools. 
  

The award winning fintech startup, DirectPay, works on supporting the economy by providing a complete digital payment ecosystem at reasonable costs. Businesses utilizing DirectPay find it to be one of the most cost-effective, real-time payment modes with the ability to monitor daily transactions and reconciliation through the dashboard or merchant app. Payments to suppliers can easily be facilitated with a click of a button through DirectPay’s fund transfers even if the suppliers hold an account in a different bank. 
  

Similarly, using the DirectPay mobile application - which complies with the BSS (Baseline Security Standards) for mobile applications, customers can make payments with ease, transfer funds by scanning the recipient’s QR code, make seamless payments at checkout, leave tips, split bills and pay merchants in 4 simple steps – login, scan, enter the amount, confirm. DirectPay works with most banks in the country through CEFT and JustPay under the guidelines of the Central Bank. 
  

This disruptive innovation journey of DirectPay poses tough challenges. That is when leadership plays a game-changing role. “We are immensely proud to receive these esteemed awards which are great examples of how we can reinvent and shape the future of banking and finance in Sri Lanka. The multitude of challenges exacerbated by the global pandemic has forced fintech’s to innovate at a speed never seen before. Winning these awards is recognition that DirectPay has risen to the occasion and dramatically transformed the industry. Huge congratulations to my team for being the disruptors, pioneers and risk-takers who believe in changing the landscape of payments by leveraging the power of technology.” shares the Chief Operating Officer of DirectPay, Mr. Sasindu Pathiranage, adding that this is yet another achievement carved into the journey of DirectPay and they look forward to what the future holds for their booming startup.
