Founder, Nearbuy
Then approached @Razorpay, which is my payments partner. Got a card in 10 days with a 10L limit My bank has 100% visibility of my revenues. And wants an FD. RP gets to see 30% of my revenue. Issues one promptly. Guess which stock I am buying when RP goes public :)

RazorpayX Payroll (Opfin) like AWS should be one of the primary product a startup founder should subscribe to for managing the startup's payroll and its related compliances.
Prateek Sharma
Co-founder at Heelium
Another stellar product by Razorpay. Got their corporate cards in absolutely no time. Other corporate banking partners take days, if not weeks, even with a good RM and a tree load of paperwork. Super impressed! If you are a business owner, facing RBI mandate-related issues that continue to be a pain or frustrated with the pace of conventional corporate banks, give it a try.

Working with Razorpay was a big advantage with their Smart Collect System and in particlulary for tracking NEFT payments.The dashboards are very powerful and the APIs are super developer friendly and super clean. It helped streamlined lot of our processes. The journey became very easy to deal with the help of their enthusiastic team.
Shameek Chakravarty
Founder Farmizen
Razorpay took care of my payment needs completely and gave me the freedom to focus on my businesss. As I explored further, I realised - it had different products to take care of all my payment needs like payment pages for prototyping, instant settlements. Integrating with Razorpay was simple and seamless. It took less than a day to go live. Razorpay has hugely helped us in our quest to transform lives of farmers and consumers 
Ankit Agarwal
Co-founder of Phool
We initially used Razorpay along with other service providers. Our customers trusted and paid through Razorpay way more than other payment gateways and so we switched over fully to Razorpay it's been a great journey so far we want to expand across india and we are confident Razorpay will be the partner that helps our business blossom.
