DirectPay, a proud Sri Lankan start-up, is an innovative digital payments platform that makes it easier for businesses to conveniently and securely manage their payment processing needs. They recently celebrated 5 years of successful operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> of February 2023, by reaching an impressive transaction value of 13.5 billion in just 40 months.
Founder and CEO, Kanishka Weeramunda speaking about their journey stated, “As a solution provider, DirectPay was launched because we saw that there was an opportunity in the market for a fully integrated fintech provider who can provide a one-stop-shop for merchants and customers for digital payments. We did a deep dive study into the customer’s requirements, who are mainly merchants and found that their key requirements in terms of accepting digital payments are how fast they receive the confirmation of payment, how fast they receive the settlement, as well as the best rate that can be offered. Therefore, our approach was geared towards meeting these needs, and that’s how we built our product and it’s services. During the pandemic, we achieved further growth as lockdowns meant that digital banking options became more widely adopted and we were able to pivot quickly to this need.”
DirectPay launched in February 2018 has today positioned itself as a fintech company capable of end-to-end integration and offers a secure and convenient way of processing payments, enabling businesses to accept payments from customers located both within and outside of the country.
