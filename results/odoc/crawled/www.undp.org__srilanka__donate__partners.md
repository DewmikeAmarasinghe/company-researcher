###  About us
UNDP has been present in Sri Lanka for over 55 years, supporting the nation to achieve sustainable human development on economic, social and environmental informed by the Country Programme (2023-2027). UNDP collaborates closely with the Government, civil society, the private sector and communities to collectively understand development needs, priorities and responses to address gaps in meeting the SDGs. 
###  Funding and delivery
In order to achieve its mandate, UNDP relies entirely on voluntary contributions from UN Member States, multilateral organizations, private sector and other sources, in the form of unrestricted regular resources (core), and contributions earmarked for a specific theme, programme or project.
###  Our team
UNDP works in more than 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.
###  Our partners
Partnership is at the heart of everything UNDP does. We offer a nearly universal presence. Our substantial expertise—both intellectual acumen and practical experience—cuts across diverse development issues and settings.
###  Legal framework
UNDP has been formally invited to work in Sri Lanka by the national Government. See more details here.

###  Sustainable Development Goals
To meet the objectives of the Strategic Plan in line with the 2030 Agenda, UNDP is implementing six cross-cutting approaches to development, known as Signature Solutions. A strong, integrated way of putting our best work, or 'distinctive' skill set, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
###  Our focus
The 2030 Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. It recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.

##  Our Partners 
Partnership is at the heart of everything UNDP does. Our universal presence and substantial expertise cuts across diverse development issues and settings, which combined with our long legacy of trust have made us a global partner of choice.
Partners are key agents in times of crisis, with the private sector historically playing a critical and strategic role in humanitarian efforts. We work with a wide range of partners in achieving our shared vision to help countries achieve sustainable development by eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, accelerating structural transformations for sustainable development, and building resilience to crises and shocks.
With the health and food sectors being two of the most heavily affected by the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, building on established partnerships and keen interests of various actors, UNDP in Sri Lanka has leveraged its experience to develop a giving facility, comprising of two mechanisms: firstly, by channelling private sector funds towards procuring essential and non-essential medical supplies and address food security, and secondly, by channelling individual donations through a crowdfunding mechanism set up by UNDP. 
In response, key private sector actors including **Hemas Holdings PLC** , **Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company** , **Brandix Apparel Limited** and **Daraz Sri Lanka** have come forward to pledge their commitment through the facility to complement and strengthen the ongoing health sector efforts of the **Ministry of Health** and the **World Health Organization (WHO),** and food sector efforts led and coordinated by the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),** among others. **Sarvodaya** , the **United Nations Global Compact Network Sri Lanka** and **oDoc Sri Lanka** will also come on board as Strategic Partners of the facility. 
_As Sri Lanka navigates its worst economic crisis, Hemas remains committed to support our people and our country. Being the leader in Pharmaceuticals we are committed to support the most impacted vulnerable communities, and enable access to medicines. Our partnership with UNDP is in line with these efforts and we will focus on providing essential and near essential medicine to communities across the island._
**Kasthuri Chellaraja Wilson**  
Executive Director, Group CEO, Hemas Holdings PLC
Partner with us 
_Sri Lanka will rise again as businesses, individuals, local and international agencies work together with the government to ease the pain our nation is suffering. Circumstances demand that we all act with the kindness and empathy that Sri Lankans are known for. With this mindset, we will face the present and future crises with strength. We are blessed to have the possibility of helping at this time, and thank UNDP Sri Lanka for initiating this collaboration while inviting every business that can help, to support the effort._
**Dilhan C. Fernando**  
CEO, Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company
Partner with us 
The Inspired People of Brandix pledge our commitment to thoughtful solutions to the food security challenge we face as a nation. Through our Manusathkara initiative, we already uplift the lives of our employees and the communities in which we operate in with our Model Village programmes across Sri Lanka, and with this partnership with UNDP, we will infuse much-needed inputs for short and medium-term relief assistance to restoring seasonal agricultural cycles. Our efforts will create immediate impact to tackle the challenges at hand, and also drive positive sustainable change.
**Natasha Boralessa**  
Group Director, Brandix Apparel Limited
Partner with us 
Given the country's development to middle-income status, mobilizing funds from beyond Sri Lanka will be challenging, but a concerted effort with international organizations like the UNDP to raise awareness of Sri Lanka's humanitarian crisis among the global community is an important first step. We need to work to start the required conversations, explore all possible options and leverage our technology, markets, networks and resources to mobilize private sector funds outside of Sri Lanka.
