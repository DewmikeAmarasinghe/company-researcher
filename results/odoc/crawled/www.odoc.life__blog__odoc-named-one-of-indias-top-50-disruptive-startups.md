## oDoc named one of India’s top 50 disruptive startups
oDoc has been recognised as one of India’s top 50 disruptive startups for 2019 by YourStory.
YourStory is India’s largest media-tech company for startups, entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and changemakers.
Having only started their Indian operations in June 2019, oDoc has proven its worth to Sri Lanka’s neighbour to be placed 33rd amongst India’s most disruptive startups. The 50 startups that were named are all using technology to create a profound impact and change lives for the better. oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine service provider, is the only non-Indian company to be featured on this prestigious list.
“Three years ago, my little son was feeling unwell in the middle of the night. My wife and I rushed him to the hospital for a consultation. The doctor diagnosed him with a minor ailment and mentioned, with an apologetic look, that I didn’t need to bring him. This series of events used to occur almost on a monthly basis. It made me wonder about the number of people who make unnecessary trips to the hospital, wasting both money and time. While on yet another visit, flipping through a magazine in the doctor’s waiting room, I came across an article on telemedicine – a method already used throughout the world to consult doctors from anywhere over the phone. This was when the idea of oDoc was born, and now three years down the line it is gratifying and exciting to be recognised as one of the 50 disruptive startups in India,” said oDoc Co-Founder and CEO Heshan Fernando.
oDoc, which was co-founded by Fernando, Dr. Janaka Wickremasinghe, Sanjay Jayawardena and Sohan Dharmarajah, PhD, launched its commercial operations in Sri Lanka in 2017. They now have over 40 corporate clients who offer oDoc as a free health benefit to their employees. oDoc’s clientele includes Brandix, Crystal Martin, AIA Insurance, Uber, Commercial Bank and PickMe to name a few.
The oDoc app connects over 250 SLMC registered doctors with company employees, for video, audio and chat consultations within three minutes of booking, 24/7.
