How can a doctor correctly diagnose me without seeing me in person? 
Very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online. 
## What do we treat?
oDoc lets you channel SLMC registered doctors, obtain medical advice and receive a prescription if required, all from the comfort of your home. You can channel with either a GP or a specialist. The on-demand GP is available 24/7 and will call you 3 minutes after the booking is made.

WHAT THEY SAY
## Patient Reviews
"I had a phone consultation with an ophthalmologist on oDoc and sent him pictures of my eye injury. He told me what medication I needed and how I should bandage my eye. After 24 hours, my eye completely healed. I am so impressed with the service, the efficiency of the doctor and how easy and quick it was."

"I wasn’t sure how a doctor could diagnose me virtually, because I was used to going to a doctor physically. However, all my doubts were cleared during my first oDoc consultation. The doctor I consulted spent about 10mins asking about my medical history and questions about my symptoms.oDoc is my first choice when it comes to minor illnesses! Thanks oDoc!"

"I had a thyroid issue that I was worried about, so I consulted the oDoc on-demand GP in a few minutes, he prescribed me some tests, I did it and sent him the reports on the app itself, and got my medicine delivered". I didn't have to waste any time to get an initial opinion from a doctor, and I was worry-free", Thank you, oDoc."
