**oDoc offers a variety of remote medical services to patients in Sri Lanka. These include online consultations, medication delivery, and at-home sample collections for lab tests.**
oDoc, founded in 2016, has provided over 40 000 remote consultations to patients in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, oDoc partnered with Sri Lanka’s government to provide more people with safe, affordable access to primary care. From India to the UAE, countries across the world have adapted their care models to respond to changing needs, sometimes in unique ways but with virtual medicine now a core offering.
The telemedicine platform offers three monthly subscription options, depending on the level and type of care required. For Rs.499/month, users have 24/7 access to telemedicine consultations with GPs within three minutes of requesting one.
During the consultation, the registered doctor obtains medical history and symptoms from the patient using video via their app. They can provide a treatment plan, diagnosis, and prescriptions just as they would with a face-to-face appointment. If a physical assessment is required, the GP will recommend attending a clinic. However, in the large majority of cases, minor medical concerns can be handled entirely remotely.
If medication is prescribed, the patient has the option of picking up their treatment from a pharmacy of their choice, or having it delivered straight to their door with oPharma, their in-house online pharmacy service. If lab tests are required, oLab can send a team to the patient’s home for sample collection within two hours. This provides a convenient option for people who aren’t well enough to travel or do not want to risk virus transmission.
