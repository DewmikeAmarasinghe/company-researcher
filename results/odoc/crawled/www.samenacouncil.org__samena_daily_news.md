#### Sri Lanka’s eChannelling offers video medical consultations, drug delivery
eChannelling, an online medical appointment business that was Sri Lanka's first listed dotcom, has extended its value added services to offer local video consultations and provide drug delivery.   
  
The company, controlled by mobile phone firm Mobitel, a unit of Sri Lanka Telecom, has also added more hospitals to its online service.   
  
“Plans are underway to offer our customers local video consultations (oDOC) and enhance the company’s service offering by providing drug delivery services,” eChannelling Executive Director Nalin Perera said.   
  
The company ventured into a new area of service offering by partnering with ‘vDOC’, a UK-based consultation service for obtaining second opinions for patients, he told shareholders in the company’s 2017 annual report.   
  
eChannelling, which is facing competition in its online medical appointment business, from Doc.lk, a firm set up by Dialog, Sri Lanka's largest mobile firm, and Asiri Healthcare group, said it expanded its network.  
  
Its chairman P G Kumarasinghe Sirisena said that in 2017 the company was able to add 28 new hospitals to its network from outstation areas of the country, thus, enabling services to permeate the entire island.  
  
Perera said there are plans to sign up with government hospitals to provide eChannelling services.   
  
“We also plan to approach specialist hospitals and clinics that treat illnesses such as cancer and other long-term diseases to partner with us and become a part of our expanding network which provides patients an efficient and effective channelling service.”  
  
eChannelling now has over 200 hospitals and medical institutions in its network of service providers.
