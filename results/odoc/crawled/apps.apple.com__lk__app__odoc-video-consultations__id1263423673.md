A great app to consult a doctor online

oDoc is a very user-friendly app. It helped me consult a doctor in just a few minutes, saving me time, and the trip to see the doctor in person. I also got my medicine delivered quicky via oPharma which is another very useful service they provide. Kudos to the oDoc team for making our lives much easier.

Video option didn’t work despite the permission settings were set right on the phone

The app is overall good as an alternative to typical appointments at hospitals. However, for the 1st appointment, the video option didn’t work despite the permission settings on the phone were set right. (Even when booking the appointment, only the video option was there but during the call, it showed that the other person has disabled video for both doctor and I)The feedback given by customer care agents was useless, I had to carry on with an audio consultation. Then the call gets disconnected abruptly after some time as well. These issues makes it really inconvenient and it’s not worth the price we pay. I’ve already complained about this issue to the oDoc team, please fix these issues. I’m hesitant to book another appointment because of the aforementioned issues. It’s really disappointing

Worst technical support team

I have been using for some time now, recently this app not working properly like there is no audio and video working specifically after following instructions which they mentioned and did 10 times. Uninstall, install, allow access to camera and audio End of all the trouble they charge for the consultation which has not happened PS: if you’re facing the similar problem, please do not try to fix it through customer care because they don’t have access and the technical team is not following up the issue.

Based on personal experience - DO NOT recommend this app. Ik quite a few people use it but my experience has been as follows:Tried yesterday. Audio wasn’t working. Tried everything that helpline recommended ( restart phone, reinstall app, disable and enable microphone permissions on phone for the app). Nothing worked. I was desperate to consult the doctor yesterday n it failed. Had a demo call with the helpline person tried several times ( audio only, n it worked. Then tried video also n it worked ) n then scheduled a consult for today. Again when the doctor called it didn’t work. Retried all the recommendations of the helpline. Nothing worked.Cancelled and moved onto doc990. It has worked for me before. So gonna stick to that. Not gonna try using this app again, cuz it failed me when I really needed to consult a doctor.

I have been using this app for a quite long period now. Overall the experience I had was very satisfied. Right at the appointment time the doctor contacted me during every appointment. And the app procedure is very user friendly.
