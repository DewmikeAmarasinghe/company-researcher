By opening doors to children in underserved communities, the Foundation continues its mission of bridging educational disparities and building brighter futures for every child, regardless of background.  
  
Currently, the Piyawara initiative operates 70 preschools across Sri Lanka. With the addition of the Pedro Estate preschool, the network now spans 71 schools nationwide, with five more under construction in different districts. This expansion reflects Hemas’ focus on reaching vulnerable communities, particularly in the plantation sector, where access to early education is limited.  
  
The opening of our first preschool in the plantation sector marks an important milestone for the Hemas Outreach Foundation. By creating opportunities for young children at the very start of their learning journey, we not only invest in their future but also strengthen the wellbeing of their families and the wider community,” said Mr. Abbas Esufally, Chairperson of the Hemas Outreach Foundation.

### Fems expands national initiative partnering Red Cross, United Communities and Ministries of Health and Education launching Api Katha Karamu Sri Lanka's largest menstrual health and hygiene education program
**-Educating 180,000+ school students islandwide to address critical gaps and create awareness-**  
  
Fems, one of Sri Lanka's leading feminine hygiene brands, has implemented an expansive menstrual health and hygiene education program, ‘Api Katha Karamu’ (Let’s Talk), covering all nine provinces across 180 schools and reaching over 180,000 students. The initiative is being carried out in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, United Communities, and with support from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.  
  
The Official MoU Signing ceremony between the Fems & partners Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, United Communities was held on 08th July 2025  
  
. The new partnerships with United Communities Guarantee Ltd.—a non-governmental organisation recognised for fostering a community of care and support—and the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society—a humanitarian organisation committed to alleviating human suffering and fostering resilience and dignity—serve as vital allies in Fems' expanded menstrual health education efforts. These organisations have played a pivotal role in facilitating connections with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education to support the nationwide program.  
  
Menstrual health education in Sri Lanka continues to face significant challenges. Of the 4.2 million menstruating women in the country, only 30% regularly use sanitary napkins. According to a study conducted by WaterAid and the UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia on menstrual hygiene management in schools, 60% of parents in Sri Lanka do not allow their daughters to attend school during their periods.  
  
Since 2021, Fems has conducted menstrual hygiene education sessions that have reached over 300,000 females across schools, plantations, prisons, and workplaces, addressing critical gaps in menstrual education, promoting proper hygiene practices, and reducing school absenteeism.  
  
The new alliance will serve as vital partners in Fems' expanded menstrual health education initiative.  
  
Sabrina Esufally, Managing Director, Hemas Consumer Brands, said, “We believe there is an urgent need in Sri Lanka for comprehensive menstrual health education and support. The partnership strengthens Fems' unwavering commitment to break down stigmas and provide knowledge and resources to Sri Lanka's school students. We hope to create lasting change that enables young women to take charge of their menstrual health with confidence and dignity. The initiative is a true reflection of our purpose to help every Sri Lankan woman become independent and rise above challenges.”   
  
“Api Katha Karamu” program will comprise targeted sessions addressing students. Each participant will receive educational materials and redeemable vouchers. In addition, select schools will benefit from the distribution of free sanitary napkin packs. The program aims to significantly reduce the number of school days lost due to menstruation—an issue currently affecting 37% of girls, who miss one to two days of school each month (according to the WaterAid and UNICEF study).   
  
Conducted by experienced healthcare practitioners, the initiative will help students understand their bodies correctly, receive accurate, age-appropriate information and make informed decisions, addressing critical knowledge gaps that have long affected young women's educational outcomes and personal wellbeing. Students will also have the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification from the healthcare practitioners on topics such as periods and female health, ensuring their concerns are addressed in a safe and supportive environment.   
  
Fems believes the program will foster understanding among today's youth and help to cultivate a generation of Sri Lankan women who can independently manage their menstrual health. The program also aligns with Fems' core purpose of enabling women to achieve greater independence and overcome societal barriers.  
  
**About Fems:**  
  
Fems, a feminine hygiene brand established in 2004, is driven by a mission to enable women to be independent and rise above societal constraints.  
  
Committed to offering a range of affordable, high-quality sanitary napkins accessible to women from all walks of life, Fems added Aya to its product range, which is specifically designed to meet the needs of budget-conscious consumers without compromising on quality. With deep understanding and empathy, Fems aims to address the evolving feminine hygiene requirements ensuring that women feel comfortable, confident, and supported. Today, Fems has established itself as a reliable brand in feminine care.  
  
At the core of the brand purpose is a dedication to educating households about menstrual health and hygiene, while simultaneously working to dismantle social stigma surrounding menstruation. Fems stands as a beacon of empowerment, a trusted ally that believes in women’s potential, supporting their journey, and celebrating their strength.

### Baby Cheramy and Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians Join Forces to Prevent Child Injuries and Launch Home Accidents Prevention Guide Booklet
Forging ahead in its mission to make the world a safer place for children, Baby Cheramy is partnering with the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians to educate parents on prevention of home accidents, a major cause of child injuries in Sri Lanka. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was inked on 7th November 2023, to cement this collaboration to uplift awareness on child safety. On the occasion, a Parental Guide booklet was also launched, authored by Prof. Manori Gamage, Professor in Paediatrics, and Dr. Kalyani Guruge, Consultant Paediatrician, on how to prevent home accidents to keep children safe. Developed in a highly informational easy to understand style,and written in child-friendly language with eye-catching poems and drawings, the booklet has the endorsement of the National Children’s Secretariat of the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment.   
  
Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, the premier professional and academic college and the leading voice involved with child healthcare, along with Baby Cheramy the most loved Baby Care brand in the country, has continuously engaged in educational initiatives to uplift child safety in Sri Lanka and together takes this step once more for the benefit of parents and children across the country. Baby Cheramy is putting its brand purpose of “creating a safer world for our babies” into action by ensuring child safety education among parents and other key stakeholders to empower them with the essential knowledge necessary to protect their children from accidents.  
  
Commenting on the initiative, Shiyan Jayaweera, Director Marketing at Hemas Consumer Brands, commented, “As the leading baby care brand, Baby Cheramy is happy to partner with the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians to address the pressing issue of child accidents in order to make a positive impact on our nation’s future. Collaborating with child health safety experts will help take our message to more people and help keep children safe, a philosophy that is central to Baby Cheramy.”  
  

Preventable child accidents continue to cause injury and death among children. Every year, 269,000 children in Sri Lanka are hospitalized due to accidents. A majority of these accidents happen in the home environment but can be prevented by taking the correct precautions.   
  
Commenting on what motivated the booklet, Dr. Kalyani Guruge said, The ‘Home is the Castle & Fortress against injury and violence’ is a popular quote. According to statistics published on injuries, the home is the most common place where young children get injured. Kids explore, have adventures, have fun and play, and in the process are more likely to get injured. When Baby Cheramy, which is part of the Hemas Group, invited me to write a booklet on home injuries, I was delighted to accept. I invited Prof. Manori Gamage to partner with me as I know her as a poet. The book is a reflection of our experience gained in the hospitals of attending to kids who present with injuries. Accidents are predictable; a few seconds of inattention can lead to disaster. Foreseeing how home injuries could happen is the best way to prevent them. Both of us believe that this booklet would be helpful to parents, teachers and children to lead a happy life without injuries.”   
  
Mr. Chandana Wijewardena, Deputy Director National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development Ministry of Women Child Affairs & Social Empowerment added: “This book is crafted with the primary aim of accident prevention. I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians for their generous resource support, and I commend Hemas Consumer Brands for their proactive role in spearheading this effort. The National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development is happy to collaborate in this endeavour.”  
  
As phase one, Baby Cheramy is planning to introduce 100,000 booklets to households within the next 12 months. This also includes E-copies which will be shared by leveraging on several platforms including the Baby Cheramy website and Facebook page, and via a QR code that will be printed on Baby Cheramy packs for parents to scan and download. The booklet will be introduced with the help of the National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs.   
  
Baby Cheramy’s dedication to create a safer world for babies is evident in its past projects which include educational initiatives tailored for expectant mothers and fathers, staunch advocacy of inclusive parenting and the holistic development of children, creating and disseminating informative parental guide booklets, and regularly engaging in expert-led educational Q&A sessions through digital media platforms.

### Hemas Hospitals makes national-level contribution through Upakara initiative for deprived CKD patients
In a concerted effort to ensure healthcare equity for all Sri Lankans, the country’s foremost trusted private healthcare provider Hemas Hospitals introduced ‘Upakara’, an unmatched timely initiative which offers free monthly dialysis cycles to a selected number of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients from low-income backgrounds, through Hemas Hospitals.   
  
Hemas Hospitals’ Upakara is a one-of-a-kind initiative, contributing to the health and wellbeing of individuals from underprivileged and less fortunate communities, who are suffering from CKD. While most individuals face difficulties with affording basic healthcare during the country’s perilous economic situation, this facility will be considered a life-saving, monumental effort from a private healthcare provider, contributing on a national level.  
  
“Chronic Kidney Disease is one among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. Statistically, 20-25 percent of diabetic patients and 18-20 percent of patients with hypertension are prone to CKD. Holistically, one in 10 Sri Lankans is estimated to have CKD, while the vast majority is unaware of the fact that they have it, resulting in most patients seeking healthcare support at its late-stages. This forces CKD patients to either opt for kidney transplants or regular dialysis treatments, both bearing an intense level of financial burden on patients and their loved ones. Given the volatile macro-economic environment in the country today, this financial burden is heavier than ever before,” stated Dr. Lakith Peiris, Managing Director Hemas Hospitals.  
  
“A statistically higher number of CKD patients from the underprivileged communities who are affected by fewer resources prompted us to address this issue by extending our support to these communities with essential infrastructure and services through Hemas Hospitals’ Upakara initiative,” he added. CKD is fast becoming a major public health concern, attracting increased global attention due to rapid spread of the disease, and its grave impact on patients and their quality of life. With a larger number of CKD patients reported from Sri Lanka each year, the national healthcare system often finds it difficult to cater to the full requirement of all patients requiring dialysis, affecting their health and wellbeing on a large scale. With the aim of ensuring good governance and community participation, Upakara will be overseen and operated by a governance committee inclusive of key opinion leaders within the hospital and communities.  
  
With a vision of ‘Making Healthful Living Happen’, Hemas Hospitals intends to support CKD patients in a manner that eases the great financial burden that falls on them every month and enhances their access to life-saving dialysis treatment. At a time in the country when macro-economic volatility has destabilized personal economies, Upakara will lend greatly to easing the financial pressure of healthcare on these chronic patients and enable them to re-establish a sense of wellbeing.  
  
“Therefore, in such a dire context, we believe Upakara is an important step forward in assuring health and healthcare equity in Sri Lanka, and consider it our duty as a responsible healthcare provider to ensure that all Sri Lankans have access to the life-saving treatment they require regardless of their financial background. Upakara was therefore borne with this vision, and we consider ourselves privileged to launch this vital CSR programme as we continue to work to eliminate disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases in Sri Lanka,” stated Dr. Peiris.

### Diva Dathata Diriya unlocks the power of female entrepreneurs
Recognizing the immense contribution women make to their family, community and country, Diva, a proudly Sri Lankan brand, has partnered with Women in Management (WIM) to conduct training sessions on entrepreneurship and skills development to help women market their home-grown products and services. The first Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative started in Dankotuwa in January 2023 and will be rolled out nationally to other locations. On completion of a nine-day training session, an award ceremony was held by Diva, which is manufactured and marketed by Hemas Consumer Brands, to celebrate and recognize the journey of the participants. The program will also keep engaging with the participants and track their progress, and eventually, and the top three female entrepreneurs will receive capital funding to accelerate their entrepreneurial journey. Diva thrives on supporting women, giving them strength and empowering them.  
  
In a majority of Sri Lankan households, the burden of nurturing families falls on the women in the household. Women’s nurturing hands cook, clean, do laundry and care for their families. The helping hands of women brighten the future of her children, add life to the family, build communities, and as part of the workforce, make a significant contribution to the national economy. However, despite the fact that they can win the hearts of the world, some women lack the adequate time, knowledge and support to fulfill their dreams. This realization sparked the creation of the Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative to provide a supporting hand to talented entrepreneurs. The Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative will support women with career advice and professional skills; equip women with financial and digital literacy skills to manage their households and businesses; support community initiatives at the grassroots; and attract more women into the workforce, ultimately benefitting the nation. Elaborating further, Mrs. Anushka Sabanayagam, Category Head Home Care of Hemas Consumer Brands, said, “Diva’s brand purpose is to make women’s lives easier by being the source of support for their well-being and progress. As a helping hand to women, we aim to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to embark on their entrepreneurial journey through the Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative. We are excited to provide the top three winners with access to finance to fulfill their entrepreneurial dreams. This project is an extension of Diva’s brand purpose - to empower women and make their lives easier so that they can fulfill their ambitions. Diva’s superior products are infused with efficiency and deliver the best results in less time, which allows women to take care of their household well and yet leaves them free time to engage in their passions and fulfill theirn dreams.”  
  
A famous poet once wrote, “The hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world”, which implies that women nurture the next generation and thus have a strong influence on events in the country and should be admired and loved. Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative understands this inherent strength and potential that women possess and thereby facilitates and encourages them to develop their skill sets for the future.  
  
During its journey spanning over 20 years, Diva has been able to support Sri Lankans with superior laundry care solutions while positioning itself as a local household brand that understands the local consumers’ evolving needs.

### Hemas Partners with Clean Ocean Force to Tackle Plastic Pollution in Jaffna
Hemas Holdings PLC partnered with Clean Ocean Force to tackle plastic pollution in Jaffna by restoring Gurunagar, one of the most polluted fisheries landing sites and adopting “Point Pedro” beach, situated at the extreme Northern Point of Sri Lanka.  
  
Hemas Holdings PLC becomes the first corporate to join hands with Clean Ocean Force as they step into the Northern Province and carry out daily cleaning operations, and community awareness and engagement to keep the Jaffna waterways free from plastic waste. The initiative will take place in two stages; removing the top layer of floating plastic, PET, and other floating pollutants and with the use of machinery and human labour remove plastics at the bottom of the lagoon. The project will enable community mobilisation and participation in making Jaffna a region free of plastics while driving economic development of the residents involved.  
  
With the increased development activities taking place in the Jaffna District, the issue of plastic pollution has come to the fore, driven by the plastic waste that has been finding its way to the Jaffna lagoon, a vital piece of marine ecosystem sustaining the life of the Jaffna Peninsula. Major landing sites of fishing boats in Jaffna such as Gurunagar, Paasaiyoor, and Kachchai have been significantly affected with various forms of plastic waste including PET and single-use plastics and polythene being found in increasing quantities on the shores, posing a threat to both the livelihoods of the people and the marine wildlife, including endemic species of the region.  
  
Clean Ocean Force has in place a Tri-Party agreement with the Department of Local government in Northern Province and Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), while the project is monitored by the Hon Governor of Northern Province. Other stakeholders of the project include the Central Environment Authority, Coastal Conservation Department, Sri Lanka Police Environmental Division, Northern Province Tourism Bureau, Marine & Tourist Division of Sri Lanka Police, and many other voluntary organizations.

### Hemas Partners Clean Ocean Force to Safeguard Negombo’s Threatened Ecosystems
Partnership: Clean Ocean Force
Location: Negombo
Hemas Holdings PLC and its subsidiary Hemas Consumer Brands signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Clean Ocean Force (COF) to carry forward their strong commitment to protect Sri Lanka's natural environment through sustainable and responsible operations relating to the use and disposal of plastic waste. The MoUs will allow the two parties to combat plastic pollution in sensitive areas of the Negombo region for a more sustainable future.   
  
The partnership between Hemas Holdings and COF will engage in a beach caretaker project along ‘Poruthota beach’ and Hemas Consumer Brands partnership will focus on a clean-up of the ‘Negombo lagoon’. The lagoon faces massive environmental challenges as it is connected by many canals and waterways that act as a pathway for plastic debris and pollutants. The addition of polythene, plastic, abrasives, and silt to the Negombo lagoon is destroying its biodiversity and endangering the entire marine ecosystem because the lagoon connects to the Indian Ocean It is estimated that through the project, 350 to 500kgs of PET bottles will be removed, along with another 100kgs of other plastics, cans and pollutants through a weekly and bi-weekly plastic removal and directed to their sorting centres before being sent for recycling. Through the above process, underprivileged communities in the area are rewarded with incentives that will motivate them to perform such work towards protecting beaches and waterways while uplifting their livelihoods. This income assures that these volunteers can expect a steady monthly income during the prevailing economic crisis period.

A majority of cancer diagnosed women face traumatic situations due to hair loss, which have led them to stay away from their comfort zones. Even though most women are willing to undergo treatment, hair loss becomes a major concern for them that holds them back, causing them to shy away from social interaction, relationships, places of worship and more.
