hSenid Business Solutions CEO Sampath Jayasundara mentioned: “Being a people-centric organisation, our aim is to help employers look after the most important asset of their business, ‘its people’ in the best way possible.
We let them focus on their employees, while our team focuses on the processes.
The integration with oDoc now helps us take a step further in this relationship as we now have the opportunity to not only help with the processes behind HR, but also create an impact towards the wellbeing of employees and this could not have happened at a more needful time.”
oDoc has launched the Sri Lanka National Telemedicine Platform on behalf of the Ministry of Health.
