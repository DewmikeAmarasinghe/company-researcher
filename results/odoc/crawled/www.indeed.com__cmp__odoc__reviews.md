### Consistent
#### Procedure officer
Oklahoma
The job offers great consistency even with constant changes in the agency. Leadership is great as well. I enjoy my time working with this agency. The job itself is for certain people. Not everyone. If you like to be tied down to your desk everyday it is for you.

### Don’t. 
#### Officer 
Oklahoma 
They work you to death and don’t care about you as a person. Treated worse than the inmates. If you don’t give them all your time then you’re basically useless.

### Sucks
#### Guard
Oklahoma
Not quite a very solid place to choose to want to spend a life time wandering the wonderous marvels of the occupational part of your life time. Go federal

### Do not recommend unless last resort 
#### Correctional Security Officer
Oklahoma City, OK
Great coworkers but the whole agency is short staffed and mandatory hours is mandatory. The pay isn’t worth it and policy isn’t enforced when it comes to inmates but is upheld to the staff. This isn’t a job for someone who cares to makes a difference.

### Flexible
#### machinist
Oxnard, CA
Willis Machine was a great attribute to my career and learning experience. My time at the company allowed me to excel to a point, but more knowledge was hindered due to the production supervisor. I wanted to be more involved in programming but it never happened due to lower managements need for job security....Show more
